            <title>A generall treatise against poperie and in defence of the religion by publike authoritie professed in England and other churches reformed. VVherein they that either want leisure to read, or that haue not iudgement to conceiue, or that are not able to buie the learned treatises of other concerning particular points of religion, may yet euidently see poperie not to be of God, and our religion to be acceptable in his sight. Very necessarie for these times, for the confirmation and strengthening of men in our religion, that neither by Iesuits, nor by any other, they may be drawne to poperie, or any other heresie or sect: and likewise for the winning of Papists and atheists to an vnfained liking and true profession of our religion.

            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Truly ſo that although they themſelues were not one whit transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Chriſt, yet they could haue bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent for euer to haue dwelt in that mountaine, onely
<pb facs="tcp:14153:6"/> to haue enioyed this glorious ſight of Chriſt, Moſes, and Elias. For what ſaid they?

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloved I am not ignorant, howe dangerous a thing it is to write bookes in theſe daies, partly in reſpect of the greate varietie of all learning in many, vvhich thereby are able more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie to finde a fault in any man his vvritings, then the author (for the most part) himſelfe, and partly of the great curioſity of other vvhich are readie to reprehend the best, and to finde a knot in a ruſh; yea not onely to carpe at that vvhich deſerueth no blame, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to condemne that vvhich they ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to commend, or vvhich at the leaſt they cannot amende. The conſideration of this, did at the firſt make me for a long time to vviſh this labour that I haue novve taken, to haue beene ſet vpon by ſome other, more able to haue gone (as we ſay) through-ſtitch therewith then my ſelfe, before I durſt once beginne to ſet my penne to paper for the writing my medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:14153:8"/> thereof. After alſo that I had begun ana finiſhed this treatiſe, in ſuch ſort as novv it commeth forth (ſome ſmale things onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) I ſtaied the publiſhing thereof, to ſee if any other vvould haue preuented me in this argument, that ſo I might not haue laide my ſelfe open to thoſe reprehenſions and cenſures, vvhich nowe perhaps I may incurre and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine. At the laſt ſeeing none other to deale therein, and thinking it to be a thing very profitable, yea beeing perſvvaded of the profit thereof by ſome other, whome I deſired to read the ſame written; (as vvhoſe iudgements I did much better truſt vnto then to my ovvne) I laid aſide all ſuch feare: and reſpecting the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of many, more then mine owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate credit and eſtimation vvith a few, I haue boldly committed it (as ye ſee) vnto the print, and doe novve exhibite it vnto your reading. Although therefore it may be, that it ſhall paſſe through the fierie and ſharpe purgatorie of many ſuch quicke heads &amp; nimble tongues, as to vvhich almost nothing will be welcome: yet I hope that it ſhall alſo finde courteous and fauurable entertainment with many, which will make ſuch profitable vſe thereof, as I haue commended in the ende, and in regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I regard not all the obloquie of the other. I
<pb facs="tcp:14153:8"/> craue alſo yea and truſt, that what faultes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer haue eſcaped me herein, they may be the more fauourably interpteted, and the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie pardoned, becauſe this treatiſe is not onely the firſt fruites of my labours thus publiſhed, but alſo ſuch an argument, as wherein I doe not remember any other profeſſedly to haue taken the like paines. If hereafter any man of great learning generally and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of much reading and deepe iudgement in diuinitie, ſhall thinke this worke to be inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in this kinde, and ſhall therefore take the ſame theame in hand, and handle it more ſubſtantially and ſufficiently: I ſhall not onely not enuy the ſame or be grieued therevvith, but I will alſo vvillingly accept it, reuerently eſteeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, and be hartely glad of it. In the meane time I entreat all Christian readers of this booke, thankfully to looke, and charitably to peruſe the ſame, euen as they would haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to accept the like trauell of themſelues. Neither let them be offended vvith my plaine manner of handling theſe arguments, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let them ſeriouſly vvaie the matter and ſubſtance it ſelfe. For it is not fineneſſe of vvordes but pith of matter that must edifie to the vvorking, confirming, or increaſing of true faith and godlines. Good and whole ſome
<pb facs="tcp:14153:9"/> meate is not the vvorſe to be liked, for beeing ſerued to the table in a earthen or wodden veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. If alſo one argument pleaſe not, yet let no man be diſcouraged, but let him proceede to the next, and ſo to them that followe. Where there is varietie of diſhes, there men not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of one vvill taſt of an other. The like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour I entreat in the reading of theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hoping that the further men proceede in reading this treatiſe, the better ſauour they will finde therein. Nowe as I entreat all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian readers generally to accept courteouſly of my paines in this booke, ſo more specially I pray the ſame of ſuch, as are my friends dwelling in the places before mentioned, or elſwhere. For beeing ſpecially bound vnto them, either by kindnes or by kinred, and beeing not able to doe that good to theſe that nature it ſelfe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, I was the more willing to publiſh this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, as a teſtimonie of my thankefulnes to the one, and of my welwiſhing mind vnto the other.

            <p>The reaſons why this worke was taken in hand and the ſtate of this cauſe beeing firſt breefly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then followe theſe generall arguments againſt popery and for our religion.</p>
            <p n="1">1 All true religion and acceptable to God, is wrought in the hearts of men by the miniſterie of God his word conteiued in holy ſcripture. Popery is not wrought by the miniſterie of that worde in as much as where that word is moſt plentifully &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely taught, there popery moſt falleth, and where that word is wanting there popery moſt abounde, as alſo becauſe papiſts will neither voluntarily come, nor by authority be drawne, either to the preaching or reading thereof in our Churches, neither doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the priuate reading thereof at home, <hi>ergo</hi> Popery is not true religion &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2 All true religion is vpheld and maintained by good and lawefull meanes, needing no euill &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavvefull meanes to vphold it. But popery is vpheld
<pb facs="tcp:14153:11"/> and maintained by all vnlawfull meanes, as by force and violence, by fire and fagot, corrupting, adding vnto, and diminiſhing the text of ſcriptures, by falſe alleadging the authorities of men, by clipping and mangling the works of the auncient fathers, both in citing their teſtimonies, and alſo in printing of the bookes themſelues by authority of the popiſh church, by lying miracles, and ſuch other indirect meanes, <hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The ſubiect matter of true religion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the written word of God. The ſubiect mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of poperie is not compriſed in that written worde of God, but is directly contrarie therevnto in all, the principall points thereof. <hi>ergo</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The forme of true religion is alſo compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the canonicall Scripture. The forme of poperis is not there comprehended, but is altogether diuers from the forme of God his worſhip in that word preſcribed, yea rather poperie hath in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner no worſhip of God at all. <hi>ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 All true religion referreth all things to God his glorie. Poperie referreth not all things to God his glorie, but ſo aduanceth the Pope, ſaints, and man himſelfe, that it ſpoileth God of all his glorie. <hi>ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 True religion bringeth forth obedience to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orall law of God contained in the tenne comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. Poperie (and not Papiſts onely) baingeth
<pb facs="tcp:14153:11"/> forth no ſuch obedience, but tranſgreſſeth euery one of theſe commaundements, and that in the highest degree. <hi>ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 True religion worketh true ioy and ſound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in euery heart where it taketh true place, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying she ſame both of the preſent fauour of God, and alſo of the continuance thereof. Poperie worketh no ſuch ioy and comfort, as the which depriueth men of the Scriptures, whereby their eyes are to be opened and their mindes inſtructed in true wiſdome, as the which teacheth likewiſe that it is preſumption for a man to ſay that he is perſwaded of God his fauour, and of his owne ſaluation, and wherein no man euer knoweth whither he receiueth the true ſacrament or not. <hi>ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8 All true religion is wiſe as he that is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof. Poperie is not wiſe, but moſt fooliſh and ridiculous, groſſely worſhipping many homely relikes, abſurdly baptizing bells and Churches, &amp;c. and without all wit and reaſon (much more without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie) citing, condemning, and excommunicating them that are dead. <hi>ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9 All true religion is vnſauorie and vnpleaſant to the nature of man. But poperie is moſt pleaſant thereunto, becauſe it teacheth men not to take any paines in the ſcriptures, yea forbiddeth all ſuch paines, becauſe it affirmeth that the worke done is ſufficient howſoeuer it be done, and that therefore
<pb facs="tcp:14153:12"/> men neede not to be carefull about their hearts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo it commendeth eſpecially the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, giuing all libertie vnto men from the commaundements of God: and teaching that what good ſoeuer is neglected, or what euill ſoeuer is by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny committed, yet by confeſſion of all this with the mouth, by a little voluntarie afflicting of the bodie, and especially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by a peece of money, a man may haue forgiuenes of all. <hi>ergo.</hi>

               <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T cannot be denied but that many excellent, learned, and godly men, haue both plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and ſoundly, and alſo profitably and fruitfully writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, moſt worthie treatiſes for confutation of all particular points of poperie, and like wiſe for confirmation of all particular points of our religion. In this treatiſe alſo the myſterie of iniquitie in poperie is ſo fully diſcouered, and the truth of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from point to point particularly ſo euidently declared, that all men of any iudgement, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in thoſe treatiſes may eaſily ſee both the one &amp; the other: yea many haue ſeene &amp; doe ſee both the one &amp; the other. Notwithſtanding as many haue ſeene &amp; doe ſee it, ſo alſo Satan the god of this world doth ſtil detaine many in their former blindnes and ignorance. Yea the nearer that his kingdome is to an ende, the more diligently he goeth about like a roaring lyon ſeeking ſtill whome he may deuoure. Therefore he ceaſeth not by his chiefe inſtrument the man of ſinne,
<pb facs="tcp:14153:15"/> and child of perdition (I meane the Biſhop and Pope of Rome) continually to ſend forth into all corners of the realme ſwarmes of Ieſuits and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie prieſts, as to harden thoſe in poperie that haue not yet renounced that profeſſion, ſo alſo to infect other there with that are either of no religion, or that hauing embraced ours are not yet ſufficiently ſetled and grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And truly both waies he doth the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, partly becauſe many haue not abilitie to buie the bookes of particular controuerſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs and the Papiſts they beeing ſome what coſtly, partly becauſe they haue no leiſure to read them beeing many and large, and partly becauſe they haue no iudgement to conceiue of them beeing matters of learning and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly handled. Where he cannot effect that which he would for the hardening of men in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, or drawing them to poperie, there he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another waie to worke, either corrupting them with ſome other hereſie, or making them altogether profane, and working in them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all religion. Becauſe all is one to him, whether men be Papiſts, or other heretikes, or of no religion at all.</p>
               <p>2 Thus therefore ſeeing true religion euery where to decay, &amp; the kingdome of Satan more and more daily to be enlarged partly by poperie, partly by other hereſies, and partly by profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and contempt of all religion, I haue thought good an other waie to trie the conuerſion both of the ignorant Papiſts that are yet perſwaded
<pb facs="tcp:14153:15"/> their religion to be ſound and true, and that wherein they pleaſe God, and alſo of other heretikes and profane perſons themſelues, if it be poſſible, and likewiſe the confirmation and ſtrengthening of ſuch as profeſſing our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in ſhewe, are notwithſtanding vnſtaied and wauering, and therefore readie to be drawne any other waie. To all theſe therefore I doe here offer theſe generall arguments fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, in defence of our religion, and againſt poperie, ſo briefly and plainely ſet downe, that euen all that are not able to goe to the price of bookes of particular controuerſies, or that cannot intende the reading of them to waigh and conceiue them, may yet generally ſee the truth of our religion, and the falſhood of poperie, and ſeeing theſe things, may likewiſe more ſeriouſly conſider of our religion: and contrarily of the moſt daungerous, fearefull, and wretched eſtate of all Papiſts, and likewiſe of all other that are not as yet of our religion; that ſo the one ſort may not forſake our holy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and the other may ioyne with vs: and that both ioyned together in one truth, may zealouſly profeſſe it, bringing forth plentifull fruits thereof. Neither would I haue men whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to content them-ſelues with theſe generall reaſons, neglecting particular treatiſes of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular controuerſies, but rather by this treatiſe to be the more encouraged to the reading of the other, and to be made the fitter, and euery waie the more able to iudge of them.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14153:16"/>
               <p>3 That all men may the better ſee my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this whole treatiſe, and know the ſtate of the whole cauſe: by our religion, I doe here vnderſtand the religion now eſtabliſhed &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely by publike authoritie profeſſed in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and ſuch other Churches as haue iuſtly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken Rome, and are in good meaſure well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed according to the word of God contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in holy Scripture. To ſpeake more plainly, I meane by our religion that ſubſtance &amp; doctrine of faith, wherein we diſſent from the Church of Rome, and doe all of vs conſent among our ſelues, both we with thoſe other Churches, and thoſe other Churches with vs in this land. By po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie like wiſe I vnderſtand, all that doctrine of the church of Rome, which differeth and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from this our religion, &amp; the doctrine held and profeſſed publikely here in England, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches in like manner reformed. In this treatiſe therefore I doe vndertake by plaine and euident argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts fit for the capacitie of all ſorts both poore and rich, both learned &amp; vnlearned, though they can read or vnderſtand onely the engliſh tongue, to prooue that this our religion is of God, and that which God as touching the ſubſtance and doctrine thereof, doth well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and like of: and contrarily, by like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as plainely to ſhew that poperie is not of God, and therefore alſo not in any account with him, but abominable and deteſtable in in his ſight.</p>

               <head>THE FIRST ARGVMENT TOVCHING THE <hi>breeding and begetting of</hi> true religion.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HVS hauing declared both the reaſons that moued me to this work, and likewiſe the ſtate of the whole cauſe ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled herein, I will now enter into the arguments the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Here therefore firſt of al, let vs conſider the chiefe and principall meanes: whereby both that religion that is of God, and acceptable vnto God is at the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne and framed, and afterward further built and perfected in them that atteine vnto it, and alſo of the like meanes, whereby poperie is at the firſt hatched, and afterward brooded &amp; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrengthoned. Touching the former, it is moſt certaine that it is alwayes begunne by the word of God. For the Apoſtle S. Paule expreſſly teacheth vs. Rom. 10. 17. <hi>That faith is by hearing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14153:17"/> the word of god preached.</hi> S. Iames alſo chap. 1. 18. ſaith, <hi>that we are begotten againe by the word of truth.</hi> Our Sauiour likewiſe in the parable of the ſeede. Matth. 13. plainely ſheweth that, <hi>that onely is good ground into the which the ſeede of god his word falling bringeth forth good fruite,</hi> and ſo likewiſe that, <hi>that onely is to be accounted good fruite which ſpringeth from the ſeede of the word.</hi> As the word of god is the only ordinary meanes whereby faith and regeneration are begunne in euerie man whome God will haue to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: ſo alſo it is the eſpeciall meanes, whereby they are to be further built till they be finiſhed. S. Peter exhorteth the Chriſtians to whome he wrote, <hi>that as they were allreadie borne a new by the word of God.</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 23. <hi>So alſo as new borne babes they ſhould deſire the ſincere milke of the word, that they might grow thereby,</hi> chap. 2. verſe. 2. Saint Paule likewiſe hauing firſt exhorted the Theſſalonians, <hi>not to quench the ſpirit,</hi> which they had receiued, that is to cheriſh the ſpirite, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the worke of faith &amp; regeneration wrought by the ſpirit (a <hi>Metonymy,</hi> of the cauſe for the effect) preſently admoniſheth them, <hi>not to deſpiſe prophecying.</hi> 1. Theſſ. 5. 20. Where by prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> of the ſpeciall for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,) he meaneth the preaching onely of the ſame word by the which before they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Spirite. Our Sauiour Chriſt alſo in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to the ſeuen Churches of Aſia, Reuelat. 2. and 3. Exhorting thoſe Churches to repentance, conſtancie, keeping of the thinges they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14153:17"/> &amp; the encreaſing of them, addeth in the ende of thoſe Epiſtles this generall admonition, <hi>Let him that hath an eare, heare what the Spirite ſaith to the Churches,</hi> whereby he giueth all men to vnderſtand, that hearing of that which the ſpirite ſaid to the Churches, was the eſpeciall meanes for the working and encreaſing of the thinges commended in thoſe Epiſtles to the Churches.</p>
               <p>2 All this hitherto ſpoken of the word of God, is to be vnderſtood onely of the word of God written and conteined in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For whatſoeuer the Papiſtes ſay of their vnwritten verities, as equiualent to the doctrine of the Scriptures, yet that there are no ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written verities of ſuch authoritie, and ſo to be eſteemed as it hath beene ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly prooued by that worthy man, &amp; of holy memorie M. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, and other learned men that haue particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly delt in that cauſe, ſo is it alſo euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by that generall admonition before ſpoken of, giuen to the ſeuen Churches, becauſe in it by hearing that which the ſpirit ſaith, is not meant any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written veritie, but that which before Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus had commanded Iohn to write to the ſeuen Churches.</p>
               <p>3 Theſe thinges beeing thus euident tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that religion that is of God, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto God, let vs now ſee by what meanes Poperie is hatched and brooded. Here let a view be taken of the Papiſts within our owne land and abroad, yea of all whatſoeuer, whereſoeuer and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14153:18"/> whenſoeuer; which of all them may be ſaid to be begotten and wonne to that religion, by the preaching of the word of God comprehended in the Scriptures? which of all theſe can be ſaid to haue beene confirmed and ſtrengthened in that ſame religion by the ſame worde? Verelie it is moſt certaine that poperie is begunne, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and perfected not by that word, but by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions onely and doctrines of men. The more men are purelie inſtructed in the word of God, the more they heare &amp; conſider of the doctrine of the Scriptures, the further are they from all poperie; the more they diſlike and abhorre the ſame. Againe, the leſſe men are acquainted with the word of God, the ſeeldomer they heare it, or reade it, the more capable certainlie are they of all poperie, the more alſo are they confirmed and ſtrengthened, yea rather hardened in all poperie. This is moſt euident; Firſt, becauſe as the pure preaching of the word of God decayed in the world, ſo poperie grew and encreaſed; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe ſithence the ſincere preaching of this word hath beene againe reuiued in theſe latter times: the more hath poperie waſted and pined according to the prophecy of the Apoſtle who hath ſaid, <hi>that the Lord ſhould conſume An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt with the ſpirite of his mouth.</hi> 2. Theſſ. 2. 8. Thirdly, the ſame is manifeſt by diuers examples of places and perſons in our owne land. For where the Goſpell is moſt plentifully and truely preached, there are feweſt Papiſtes, and where the Goſpel is leaſt preached, there is the greateſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14153:18"/> number of papiſtes. Some places which were moſt popiſh of all the cuntrey where they are, before they had the preaching of the word, are now ſithence that god in mercie hath vouchſafed the ſame vnto them, moſt free of poperie &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes. My ſelfe as young as I am, did know the time long ſithence the happie Reigne of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, when we in Kent was moſt accounted &amp; alſo was indeede the moſt popiſh place of all that countrie. But ſithence it hath pleaſed God to ſend vnto them the miniſterie of his word, poperie hath there vaniſhed as the miſt before the Sunne: and now I thinke it is leſſe noted for popery, then any other place, eſpecially then any place which hath not had the word, as that hath had it. Yea few places are more forward the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that in true profeſſion of our religion. The like may be ſaid of many other places, both in the South, and alſo in the North partes of England. <hi>Again,</hi> who are the moſt obſtinate papiſts in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d? are they not thoſe that neuer haue heard the word of god preached vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? or that hauing heard it, are fallen away from it? and what is the cauſe why manie are ſo obſtinate in poperie? Is it not becauſe they will not be dravven to heare that word of God neither yet to reade it? Truelie I doubt not but that if it might pleaſe God to giue vnto them willing mindes to heare or read the Scriptures, with a true deſire indeede to keepe and embrace the doctrine in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, how contrarie ſoeuer to that which in times paſt they haue held or doe yet hold, then
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14153:19"/> the more they ſhould heare or reade, the more they would diſlike of their former religion. In the meane time whilſt they care not for hearing or reading, whileſt they deſpiſe the Scriptures, whileſt they raile of the hearing and reading of them (as many of the moſt learned papiſtes do) what do they elſe but be wray, that they are not yet begotten vnto God by them, neither the children of God, &amp; that therefore their religion is not of God. For if they were begotten vnto god, and that by the doctrine of the Scriptures, if they were the children of God, as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine and boaſt of them ſelues, would they not delight to heare his word? at leaſt would they not delight to reade the word by whomeſoeuer brought vnto them? what louing child is not glad to heare the voyce of his louing father, or to read at leaſt his letters ſent by others vnto him from the place where him ſelfe is? <hi>He that is of God, heareth God his word.</hi> Ioh. 8. 47. If they were, <hi>the ſheepe of Chriſt,</hi> they would <hi>heare his voyce.</hi> Iohn. 10. 27. If they ſuſpect our preaching of the word, yet they would at the leaſt come to thoſe places, where the worde is read, or they would reade it at home by themſelues, in ſuch a tongue as wherein they might vnderſtand it. Sith therefore they care not for the hearing or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, they ſhewe they are not begotten to God by it.</p>
               <p>4 As touching our religion it is begotten by the word of god, it is confirmed &amp; ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the word of God. As mens traditions
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14153:19"/> grew in requeſt with men, ſo our religion at the firſt decaied. As the vanitie of mens traditions began to be diſcerned &amp; aboliſhed by the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth of the glorious light of the Scriptures out of the cloude of poperie, ſo our religion was againe renewed and encreaſed. The more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that the Scriptures are, or haue beene, the more doth our religion flouriſh, and hath flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed from time to time. The more men heare the Scriptures, ſearch the Scriptures, meditate the Scriptures, and pray vnto God for the true vnderſtanding of the Scriptures: the more alſo do men miſlike of poperie, and grow into loue of our religion. The Papiſtes themſelues ſee this to be ſo, and can not denie it, therefore doe they by all meanes they can, not onely accuſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſuch difficultie &amp; obſcuritie, as whereby they diſcourage the vnlearned ſort from reading of them, but alſo they vtterly denie them to the common people in their vulgar tongue. On the contrarie, they care not how common their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written verities be. If they feared not the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of their religion, and the growing of ours by the vſe of the Scriptures, why ſhould they ſo ſtreightly reſtraine the common people from it? if they thought as they ſpeake and write, that their vnwritten verities were of God, aſwell as the Scriptures: why ſhould they make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more common then the Scriptures? Is it becauſe they thinke them more eaſie, and therefore fitter for the capacitie of the common people then the Scriptures? This will not ſtand with that, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14153:20"/> they make the ground of them, and which they pretend for their ſpeciall warranr: namely with the wordes of our Sauiour to his diſciples, <hi>Other thinges haue I to ſay vnto you, but yee cannot beare them now &amp;c.</hi> Iohn. 16. 12. For by theſe wordes it is manifeſt, that thoſe things which Chriſt had further to ſay vnto his diſciples, were harder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe that then he did ſpeake, &amp; are now writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, otherwiſe he would not haue added as a reaſon, why he did for a time conceale them, <hi>but yee can not beare them now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 Now to finiſh this point, foraſmuch as that religion which God accepteth and liketh of, is wrought by the preaching of his owne word, foraſmuch as Poperie hath not ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but is onely engendred by the ſlyme of traditions, and doctrines of men. Finally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the religion now publikelie profeſſed in England is both begotten by that immortall ſeede, and doth alſo grow to further perfection, by that pure milke of the word of God, therefore I conclude for my firſt argument that poperie is onely ſuch as thoſe ſlimie traditions &amp; doctrines are, whereof it is inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred, and that our religion is not of man, but of God, and acceptable vnto God.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſame is alſo manifeſt by the ſecond meanes whereby poperie hath bine from time to time, and yet is vpholden and mainteined. For as touching this, what ſhall we ſay of the impudencie of the Papiſtes, I meane ſuch as account themſelues the learned Papiſtes, both in falſifying the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, &amp; alſo in alleadging patches onely of their writinges, as making againſt vs, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out ſome part of the ſame ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces or ſome ſentence going before or following after: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both that Father his minde is made euident, and alſo our doctrine approoued? Is not this to deale with the Fathers, as the deuill doth with the Scripture againſt our Sauiour. Mat. 4. 6. And that the Papiſts doe thus abuſe the readers by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Fathers in ſuch ſort is ſufficiently ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by thoſe that haue written in particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies. To proue the APOCRYPHA bookes Canonicall Scriptures, they alleadge the teſtimonie of <hi>Augustin lib. 2. de doctrina Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiana.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14153:21"/> cap.</hi> 8. Yet that Auguſtin did not ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the word <hi>Canonicall,</hi> as they applie his teſtimonie is manifeſt in the ſame place, let the learned reader ſee Whitak. <hi>Controuerſ. 1. queſt. 1. Cap. 4. Pag.</hi> 15. In like manner they deale with Ambroſe, whoſe teſtimonie they alleadge for proofe of this: that manie things are hard in the Scriptures, thereby indeed to diſcourage all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, from reading of the Scriptures, as though all things were hard in them: and yet in the verie ſame place, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> alſo ſaith, that <hi>in the Scriptures is matter fitt for all perſons to drinke firſt, ſecond, and laſt;</hi> where by he alſo teacheth that as there are ſome things to be drunke laſt in the riuers of the Scriptures, that is, not till men be well grounded in knowledge and iudgement, ſo alſo there is for yong beginners &amp; ſuch as haue not entred, or that haue made but litle entrance. So they deale with Auguſtin oftentimes in the ſame queſtion of the perſpicuity of the Scripture, as alſo the learned reader may ſee <hi>Whitak. queſt. 4. pag.</hi> 276. In like manner they deale with the Fathers almoſt in all other queſtions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies; Sometime alſo they alleadge the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Fathers out of ſome of their books not regarding how they haue either opened their minde or retracted their former errors in other of their bookes. Sometime againe they pleade the authoritie of ſome Fathers in citing teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their bookes, which they wrote after that they were fallen into ſome hereſie. So they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge the teſtimonie of Tertullian out of ſuch
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14153:21"/> workes as he made after that he was a Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt. <hi>Whitaker. queſt. 6. pag.</hi> 449. Finallie often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are not aſhamed to name the Fathers in particular queſtions as if they were on their ſide, whereas the cleane contrarie is manifeſtlie prooued and ſhewed by our writers, and is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe euident to them that are acquainted with the writings of the Fathers. For proofe hereof let the reader looke their preface to the tranſlation of the new teſtament into Engliſh by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and likewiſe reade M. Fulke his aunſwer to the ſame.</p>
               <p>2 For their firſt reaſon, why they tranſlate the new Teſtament according to the vulgar la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tranſlation, and not according to the greeke originall is this. <hi>It is ſo auncient</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that it was vſed in the Church of God aboue 1300. yeares agoe as appeareth by the Fathers of thoſe times.</hi> But M. Fulke ſheweth: firſt that <hi>no one tranſlation was in thoſe daies commonly rèceiued;</hi> Secondly, by many examples that <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie it ſelfe of Rome in Cyprian his time, Hierome, Arnobius, Hilarie, and Ambroſe, did not followe this vulgar tranſlation, but did reade the text farre diuerſly from the ſame.</hi> In their fourth reaſon they commend it <hi>as that which for the moſt part euer ſince Hierom his time hath beene vſed in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſeruice, expounded in Sermons, alleadged and interpreted in the Commentaries and writings of auncient fathers of the latine Church.</hi> But M. Fulk prooueth and ſheweth, Firſt, <hi>that their Church ſeruice is not ſo auncient as Auguſtine his time,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14153:22"/> many of their Church leſſons beeing taken out of Beda and other writers liuing many hundred yeares after Saint Auguſtine his age.</hi> Secondly, that <hi>ſuch parts of the Scripture as ſeeme to haue beene of moſt auncient times vſed in the church of Rome are not taken out of their vulgar text;</hi> and thirdly, that <hi>ſince Ierome his time Optatus Melevitanus, Fuigentius, Primaſius, Prosper, Aquitanicus, and Leo likewiſe himſelfe Biſhop of Rome did alleadge and interpret the texts of Scripture much differing from this vulgar tranſlation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 The like may be ſaid of their belying the Fathers in their notes afterward vpon the text it ſelfe. Vpon the firſt petition of the Lords praier, Matth. 6. 12. for their olde diſtinction of ſinnes veniall and mortall, they quote certaine places of <hi>Augustine</hi> to beare the vnlearned rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in hand, that <hi>Augustine</hi> was the author or a fauourer thereof. Notwithſtanding <hi>Augustine</hi> in thoſe places quoted by them, vſeth no ſuch diſtinction, but onely ſpeaketh of ſmall ſinnes, which no man denieth. Vpon 1. Cor. 13. 10. they ſaie that S. Auguſtine, <hi>lib. 22. de Civit. cap.</hi> 29. prooueth that <hi>the Saints in heauen haue more perfect knowledge of our affaires here, then they had when they liued here.</hi> And yet S. Auguſtine in that place ſpeaketh not of the knowledge of the Saints now in heauen touching our preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires here in earth, but onely ſpeaketh generally of the perfect knowledge which all Saints both dead and yet liuing ſhall haue in the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Aboue all other places I wiſh the reader to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14153:22"/> ſee how foully they falſifie Chryſoſtome for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Peters ſupremacie vpon Ioh. 21. 17 yea how common this fault of falſifying the fathers is with them by the iudgement of themſelues, euen of the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Doway</hi> approoued by the Cenſors according to the decree of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, concerning the book of <hi>Bertrame.</hi> For this Vniuerſitie acknowledgeth how they doe oftentimes excuſe auncient writers, beeing by Proteſtants oppoſed vnto them in diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and how by deuiſing ſome pretie ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ifts they denie them, and doe faigne ſome commodious ſenſe vnto them: and therefore whereas it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth there had beene ſome conſultation for the vtter ſuppreſſing of the ſaide booke of <hi>Bertram,</hi> the ſaid Vniuerſitie concludeth that the foreſaid booke of <hi>Bertram</hi> ſhould rather beeing amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (that is, clipped and mangled at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) be tolerated, then altogether forbidden. See this more largely in the anſwer of M. Fulke to their note vpon the place of Ioh. 21. 17. but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially let the learned ſee the ſame in their <hi>Index expurgatorius,</hi> pag. 11. and 12. where alſo the reader ſhall ſee what they commaund to be cleane put out in that booke of <hi>Bertram,</hi> and what alſo to be changed or expounded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuch ſenſe as they imagine or would haue to be of his words. All this their iuggling with the people in crying out, <hi>all the Fathers, all the Fathers, are on our ſide,</hi> might be ſhewed more plentifully, but that it is not fit for this treatiſe. In like manner they are not aſhamed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14153:23"/> to belie our owne writers, and to charge them with ſuch wordes, as they neuer vſed. So they deale with that worthie, and reuerend man D. Fulke, as himſelfe ſheweth in his Defence of Engliſh tranſlations of the Bible, in his anſwer to the 49. ſection of the preface, and of the 18. and 37. ſections of the firſt chapter, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places. The like may be ſaide of their fathering new things vpon ancient writers: ſee Calvins inſtit. lib. 4. cap. 7. ſect. 20. <hi>Doth truth neede to be vpholden by ſuch notorious lies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 But all this is nothing to their intollerable impietie both in adding vnto, and alſo in detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting from the writings of the Fathers what they liſt, to make the Fathers to ſpeake nothing but that which they will haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to ſpeake. Yea thus to deale with the writings and works of the Fathers euen in the printing of them: that their whole volumes beeing ſo printed, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may thinke, that the Fathers did ſpeake and write as now their bookes are printed. In like manner they deale with ſuch notes as are by ſome new writers added to the margent of the Fathers writings for the better directing of the reader in reading thoſe writings. So alſo deale they with ſuch tables as by late writers are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and ſet in the beginning or ending of the Fathers works, for helping the reader more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to find that which he deſireth in the Fathers. Whatſoeuer in ſuch marginall notes or in ſuch tables, may any waie helpe the reader to finde any thing, or the better to vnderſtand any thing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14153:23"/> in the Fathers either againſt their errours, or for the truth receiued by vs, that haue they by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique authoritie and act of the Tridentine Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and of the King of Spaines Edict, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be blotted and raſed out of the books of the Fathers in the new printing of them. And for the better doing thereof, they haue ſet forth a table of all ſuch things as they will haue ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out by the authoritie aforeſaide. This table they call <hi>Index expurgatorius.</hi> And this table though they kept from vs a while, yet now we haue by the induſtrie and paines of <hi>Junius:</hi> who alſo in his preface thereunto teſtifieth, that at Lyons in the yeare 1559. he beeing familiarly acquainted with a printer, whoſe name he ſaith was <hi>Lodovicus Sauarius,</hi> did there ſee <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his works moſt fairely and exquiſitely printed: ſo that he could not but admire the artificiall and beautifull countenance thereof. But the printer ſeeing him ſo well to like thereof, and ſo much to be delighted there with, told him not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that if he were to buie Ambroſe his workes, he would rather buie of any other edition then of that. <hi>Iunius</hi> maruailing at that ſpeach demanded the reaſon thereof. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therefore ſhewed him from vnder his table certaine leaues of the auncient copies of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, ſome cancelled wholly, ſome other in part onely raſed, telling him alſo that thoſe were the patternes of thoſe leaues which but fewe daies before he had truly printed, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the auncient and certen patterne. But
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14153:24"/> ſaid he further, two Franciſcan Fryers by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie haue put out all theſe leaues, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe to be put into their places, contrarie to all truth of the former bookes. What they haue commaunded to be raſed out of the marginall notes and tables of the Fathers doth plentifully and particularly appeare by the <hi>Index</hi> it ſelfe ſo ſet forth by Iunius. Nowe let any indifferent reader iudge of their religion, the which by theſe meanes they are forced to vphold and maintain. Certenly if their religion were of God, it would not neede any ſuch proppes of falſhood and wickednes. Yea if the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelus or at leaſt the chiefeſt of them, thought it to be of God, they would neuer ſet ſuch rotten ſhores to keepe it vp.</p>
               <p>5 Neither ought men much to maruel at their clipping of the writings of men in ſuch ſort, ſith they deale in like ſort with the pretious come of god his owne ſcriptures. For firſt of al they haue beene bould to take away the whole ſecond commandement out of the decalogue, that ſo they might beare the common people in hand that there is nothing in the ſcriptures againſt i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, or at the leaſt nothing in the morall law to binde vs now as well as the Iewes in former time: and that this their dealing might not be eſpied by any defect in the number of the commaundements, they haue deuided the tenth commaundement into two. Both theſe things are manifeſt by their commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> primmers. The like they doe with the Scriptures in many other places, as appeareth by their vulgar tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14153:24"/> &amp; edition of the Scriptures in latine: the which although it were not theirs at the firſt, yet becauſe they condemne all other, and do onelie commaund this as authenticall, forbidding alſo anie man to appeale from the ſame to the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall text in the Hebrew and Greeke, therefore it is to be accepted theirs. In that tranſlation and edition many things are wanting that are in the originall text, and manie things alſo corrupted. In the 9. of Matth. verſe. 13. Our Sauiour ſaith. <hi>I came not to call the righteous but the ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> In their tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlation are theſe two words <hi>to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> left out. Rom. 11. 6. All theſe words are wanting in their tranſlation. <hi>If of workes then not of grace, or elſe were worke no more worke.</hi> Ioh. 14. 26. For theſe words, <hi>he ſhal teach you al things, and bringe all things to your remembrance which I haue told you.</hi> For theſe words I ſaie <hi>which I haue told you,</hi> their tranſlation ſaith <hi>which I ſhall tell you.</hi> Thus they reade for help of their traditions to make the common people beleeue, that Chriſt ſpeaketh in this place of ſome thinges, which he would ſpeak afterward, that he had nor ſpoken before. Manie other places there are in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner either clipped or corrupted. If their cauſe were good, why ſhould they ſuſteine it by ſuch vile meanes?</p>
               <p>6 Let vs here further remember their excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding crueltie, and moſt bloudie dealing, for the continuall maintenance of their religion. If fire &amp; faggot had not better holpen them, then prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching &amp; diſputing, their religion had neuer been
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14153:25"/> ſo vniuerſall as it is. For although the blood of the Martires be called the ſeed of the Church, and haue been a notable meanes to confirme many in the profeſſion of the Goſpell. Yet other alſo haue thereby been drawne from it, and for feare haue receiued poperie. As therefore the Prieſtes, Scribes, &amp; Phariſes, and other Iewes, when they were not able by the Scriptures to reſiſt the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our Sauiour, of Stephan, of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> &amp; the ſpirit that ſpake in them, did vſe force and violence for their laſt &amp; chiefeſt argument: euen ſo haue the Prieſtes, Scribes, and Phariſes of the Church of Rome alwaies done. Such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hath bin their crueltie, that as diuers wild beaſts and birdes make the fleſh and blood of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be their nouriſhment and life, ſo alſo the blood of the Proteſtants hath been their ſpeciall releefe. The crueltie exerciſed here in our owne la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, as ſometime before, ſo eſpecially in the late time of Queene Marie doth ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifully witneſſe the ſame. The like may be ſaid of the Spaniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chiefe meanes of vpholding pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, not onely in Spaine it ſelfe, but alſo in manie other countries. The crueltie thereof is ſo great and barbarous, that the crueltie of Nero, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and all other the like profeſſed enemies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt Ieſus and his Goſpell is nothing to be compared thereto. The copies thereof are to be ſeene printed in engliſh for iuſtifying that which I write. A man would thinke that all the deuills in hell ſhould neuer haue deuiſed ſuch tortures and moſt exquiſite puniſhments, except it were
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14153:25"/> thus manifeſt. Here alſo is to be conſidered the moſt bloodie maſſaker in Fraunce Anno 1572. in the which of noble men, gentlemen, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon perſons thought to be prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in Paris were ſlaine and moſt violently &amp; cruellie murthered without anie proceeding by order of law, the number at the leaſt of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand within three daies, and within leſſe then one moneth preſently after in manie other cities &amp; townes of France, were in like ſort ſlaine &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered 20000. more. So that as it ſhould haue bin with the Iewes through all the prouinces of Ahaſhueroſh, if the curſed purpoſe of Hama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had proceeded to effect; ſo alſo was it with all the knowne or ſuſpected proteſtants in Fraunce, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon whom the merciles Papiſts could lay ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: what doth this elſe witneſſe but that the religion of the Papiſts is like vnto that wicked decree of Ahaſhueroſh &amp; from the ſame fountaine? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may this be ſaid to haue bin a fault onely of that nation. For the great ioye of the Pope, with all his Cardinalls at Rome, their proceſſion, their gunſhott, and ſinging <hi>Te Deum</hi> in honor of the bloody act, doe euidently ſhew both the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the thing done by the whole Church of Rome, and alſo that the ſaid Pope and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls were acquainted with the matter before, and had an hand &amp; ſtroke in it. I confeſſe I note this out of the booke of Martires, but no Papiſt is therefore to ſuſpect the truth of the matter: for this hiſtorie there reported is but briefly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the French Chronicles and Hiſtories,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14153:26"/> which do more largely deſcribe the ſame. Beſids this act is ſo late &amp; was ſo notorious at the firſt committing thereof, that there needeth not the teſtimony of anie writer to be ſuſpected therein. Thus we ſee that <hi>a piller of blood is the chiefe piller of the Romiſh Church ſuch as now it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7 The like obiection made againſt our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from the execution of manie Seminarie prieſtes and Ieſuites in our owne land hath bin ſufficiently aunſwered by others. For they haue not been executed to maintaine and vphold our religion, but for their haynous treaſons whereby they haue ſought the ſacred life of her Maieſtie in bringing in of forreyners here to vſurpe the kingdome, and the ouerthrow of the whole land their owne naturall cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. Therefore this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treaſon againſt both their Prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, beeing eſpecially authorized by the Pope himſelf, and his Clergie, not onely for the ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the ſubiects from all obedience to her highnes, but alſo for the ſhedding of her blood, as alſo the like treaſons of manie other to the ſame intent, atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted by the ſame authoritie doe plainely diſclaime their religion as not beeing of God neither acceptable vnto God. For <hi>truth ſeeketh no corners, truth requireth no ſuch ſtilts to goe by.</hi> Neither did our Sauiour vſe ſuch meanes to commend himſelfe &amp; his doctrine, though he might haue commaunded more then twelue le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Angels, neither after his aſcenſion did the Apoſtles or anie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo further the goſpel.</p>
               <p>8 To theſe meanes before mentioned <hi>I</hi> may
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14153:26"/> add their foule abuſing of the ſimple people with pretended reuelations &amp; lying miracles, thereby to make them to account their religion to be as diuine and from heauen, as by the ſame meanes well looked into, it doth manifeſtlie appeare to be altogether diuoliſh and from hell it ſelf. Such was the practiſe of certaine Monkes &amp; Friers with Elizabeth Barton a Nunne in Kent whom they called by the name of <hi>the holie maid of Kent.</hi> This holie maide by the deuice of the foreſaid Monkes and Fryers, fained her ſelfe to liue with no other food then that which was brought vnto her immediately by the Angells of heauen, ſhee made alſo as though oftentimes ſhee laie in a traunce wherein ſhee did ſtraungly alter her cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance with the other partes of her bodie, and ſpake manie things in commendation of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, pilgrimage, and other like points of popery, and likewiſe in derogation of the Goſpell, &amp; in diſallowance of King Henrie his diuorce from the Ladie Katherine the late wife of his elder brother Prince Arthur, threatning as it were by way of prophecying that if he proceeded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he ſhould not be king one moneth after. This knauerie beeing found out both ſhee and her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors, namely certen Munks, Fryers, &amp; Prieſts, were executed for it. <hi>See the booke of Martyres, printed 1583. p. 1054. And other hiſtories thereof.</hi> The like is reported in the ſame booke. <hi>p.</hi> 1291. out of the ninth booke of Sleydan his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, of certaine fryers of Orleance in Fraunce, who becauſe the Maiors wife of the citie vpon
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14153:27"/> her death bed had deſired her husband that ſhee might be buried without the ſolemnities then commonlie vſed at the funeralls of ſuch perſons, whereby their noſes were wiped of a great part of their accuſtomed gaine, cauſed a boye in the time of their night ſeruice to make a ſtraunge noyſe in one of the vaults of the church where ſhee was buried as if he had been a ſpirit. This boyiſh ſpirit, or ſpirituall boye thus inſpired by the deuill and the fryers, and coniured like wiſe after their popiſh and deueliſh manner, hauing ſignified that he was a dumb ſpirit by ſignes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhewed that he was the ſoule of the ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iors wife before buried, now condemned in hell, for the hereſie of Martin Luther. This frierlie prancke being found out, the fryers by authority of the King were committed to priſon where they continued a long time before they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed. Let the reader ſee this more largelie in the <hi>booke of Martirs &amp; Sleidan his commentaries.</hi> As theſe and ſuch like meanes continuallie applied to ſhore vp popery, do ſhew the rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſo our religion continuing and ſtanding right notwithſtanding manie ſtormes and tempeſts againſt it, doth ſhew it ſelfe to be ſound and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden by him onely whoſe power none is able to reſiſt.

This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, firſt of all, becauſe that religion, which the Scriptures commend, is true knowledge of God, of Chriſt Ieſus, of the truth. The Lord ſaith by the Prophet Oſe. <hi>I deſire mercie and not ſacrifice and the knowledge of god more then burnt offrings.</hi> Oſe. 6. 6.

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:14153:28"/> them, as Ier. 9. 3. and in many other places. S. Peter alſo ſaith in the name of all the Apoſtles, <hi>We beleeue and know that thou art the Chriſt, the Sonne of the liuing God,</hi> Ioh. 6. 69. Our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is life eternall that they knovve thee to be the onely very God, and him whome thou haſt ſent Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Ioh. 17. 3.

The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God will haue all men to be ſaued, and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth,</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 4. And againe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth faith to be <hi>the knowledge of the truth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to godlines,</hi> Tit. 1. 1.

The Epheſians alſo <hi>not to be vnwiſe, but to vnderſtand what the will of the Lord is,</hi> Eph. 5. 17. Finally, the Apoſtle S. Peter bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Chriſtians to whome he wrote, <hi>to ioyne vertue with faith, and with vertue knowledge.</hi> 2. Pet. 1. 5. By theſe and many other the like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we ſee, that the Scriptures commend know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as the firſt matter of faith and religion. We ſee alſo what knowledge they doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, namely of God, of Chriſt, of the truth according to godlines, of the will of God, of the Scriptures themſelues, and that to all ſorts of men. Now what ſhall we ſaie is the matter of Poperie? Truly to ſpeake according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, poperie hath indeede no matter at all, but is a meere vacuitie or emptines for the moſt part. For may it be ſaide that poperie is knowledge, and that of theſe things? No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14153:28"/> but it is a principle of poperie, that <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the mother of deuotion.</hi> Therefore the whole popiſh Church generally condemneth all knowledge of God, and of the ſcriptures in the common people: prohibiting them the vſe of any part of the ſcriptures (as we haue heard before) and teaching and commaunding them onely to beleeue as the Church beleeueth. This they ſaie is ſufficient faith and ſufficient religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And indeede touching deuotion to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they ſpeake moſt truly. For no man will haue any deuotion vnto it, that knowerh ought of God in the ſcriptures. But to beleeue as the Church, that is, as their Church beleeueth, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true faith nor the ſhadow of true faith, but rather of faith in the deuills. The moſt part alſo of them when they teach this faith, haue it not, but can onely ſay that they haue it, and that they doe beleeue as the Church beleeueth. The moſt (I ſaie) doe onely ſaie that they doe ſo beleeue. They doe not in deede beleeue, as the Church beleeueth. For how can they, ſith they knowe not what the Church beleeueth? Yet are their bare words taken &amp; allowed for currant, good, lawfull faith of Rome. I graunt with griefe, that many amongſt vs know not the principles of our religion: yet no man alloweth ſuch igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but euery godly man condemneth it, and is grieued for it. But be it that they did in deede beleeue as their Romiſh Church beleeueth, and that they knew as much as the beſt Doctour and all their Romiſh Doctours know touching their

               <p>For now to enter into the particular matter of their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Firſt the Scripture teacheth vs ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that there is but one God, one Lord, one Mediatour betweene God &amp; man, Chriſt Ieſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but poperie teacheth that there are many gods, &amp; many mediatours. For doth it not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate the peculiar properties of God, the vbiquitie or vniuerſall preſence, and ſuch like vnto the body of Chriſt? and doe they not ſo make an other god thereof? doe they not attribute the doing thereof to ſeuerall ſaints for ſeuerall countries, diſeaſes, and other ſeuerall affaires, which is onely proper to God, whereby they make ſo many ſeuerall gods, as their are ſaints in their Kalender? doe they not alſo aſcribe power to forgiue ſinnes vnto the Pope, and to euery ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen prieſt, which yet God challengeth onely to himſelfe, and which alſo their forefathers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be God his owne due? Yea doe they not in their Decretals, Diſtinctions, Canons, and ſuch other bookes allowed by generall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of their Church, in moſt plaine words write that of him which is a ſo the onely prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue-royall of God? verely it can not be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For proofe hereof to the reader, I will ſet downe ſome of their owne words, that no man may challenge me of a ſlander, neither the pope himſelfe bring any action againſt me for belying his holines. Theſe therefore are the words of the gloſſe vpon the diſtinction. <hi>Jn canone Quanto de tranſlatione epiſcopi, titulo 7<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Papa dicitur ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sere

And he can make ſomething of nothing: and that ſentence which was none (or nothing worth) to be ſomewhat (or of force) becauſe in thoſe thinges that he will, to him will is for reaſon. Neither is there anie man that may ſay, why doeſt thou ſo? For he can diſpenſe aboue right, and of that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice make iuſtice, correcting and changing lawes, becauſe he hath full authoritie.</hi> Who doth not ſee by theſe wordes that they make the Pope ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God? for to change the nature of thinges, as God turned Lott his wife into a pillar of ſalt, made Baalam his aſſe to ſpeake, and gaue Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar the heart or qualities of a beaſt, to make ſomething of nothing, to make iuſtice of iniuſtice, as God is ſaid to ferch light out of darknes, to make his owne will ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to diſpenſe aboue right, to correct &amp; change lawes, to haue ful authority to do al theſe things, is it not proper vnto God? An other alſo of their

Deus in terris, maior homine, minor Deo, plenitudinem obtinens poteſtatis.</hi> That is, <hi>If it be asked, how farre the pope his authoritie extendeth, I aunſwer briefly, that it extendeth to all that is good, to nothing that is euill, for he is as God in the earth, greater then man, and leſſe then God, hauing full authoritie.</hi> Marke good reader, how they are not aſhamed euen to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute theſe words vnto him, whereby the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth deſcribe Antechriſt. 2. Theſſ. 2. 4. ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>he ſhould ſitt as God &amp;c.</hi> So God will haue themſelues to acknowlenge the Pope to be Antichriſt, though they intend no ſuch thing, but rather to make him God, or at the leaſt pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow with God. In their Decretalls alſo they write, that <hi>the Pope is neither god nor man, but the Viccar of God, and mixt or compounded of God and man.</hi> Oftentimes alſo they aſcribe vnto him all power aſwell in heauen and hell, as in earth. But for further view of the monſtrous blaſphemies of the Pope, I refer the reader to the large deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him which is in the booke of Martyrs, in the verie end of King Henrie the 7. his reigne, &amp; in the verie ende alſo of the firſt volume, where
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14153:30"/> plentifully are laid downe both their wordes of him, and alſo the places of their owne bookes quoted, in which any man may finde them. By theſe things it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that although they think great ſcorne to be charged, to teach that there are many Gods, yet in truth by communicating that vnto other, which is God his onely due, they teach as much. God himſelf hath ſaid, that <hi>he will not giue his glorie to any other,</hi> but they ſcotch not, they feare not to giue it to manie other.</p>
               <p>3 The like do they touching the Mediatour: For they teach that there are manie Mediators, yea ſo many as there are Saints, and a great many more. Yea they teach that the Virgine Marie is not onely a Mediatour, but alſo a Mediatour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue Chriſt himſelfe. For proofe <hi>I</hi> will note their owne words, but yet onely in Engliſh for breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſake. Thus therefore they ſpeake to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Marie as I do faithfully tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlate their words in a certaine horarie &amp;c. <hi>Reioyce O celeſtiall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, triumphantly praiſe God thy Sauiour, which hath made thee ſingular. Thou waſt content to be called the handmaid of Ieſus Chriſt; but as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine law teacheth, thou art his Ladie; For right and reaſon requireth that the mother ſhould be aboue the Sonne. Therefore aske humblie and commaund loftilie that he guide vs, that are here in the euening or twilight of the world vnto the ſupreame kingdom;</hi> And againe in the ſame place. <hi>Thou alone art without example, whome god hath choſen to be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat our betweene God and man, the repairer of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14153:31"/> world, the end of deſtruction, the waſhing away from ſinnes, the way of counſell, the truſt of reward, the ladder of hèauen, the gate of paradiſe.</hi> In their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon praiers alſo they call her <hi>the mother of grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> hope of them that are in miſerie, the mother of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, the Sauiour of the oppreſſed, the phiſick of the ſicke, all to all.</hi> What can be more contrarie to the doctrine and matter of religion? for this is not onely to make her another Mediatour, but alſo another God: and indeed if ſhe be another Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, ſhee muſt alſo of neceſſitie be another god: becauſe there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no Mediatour, which is not alſo god. Neither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is this much to be marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at, for they alſo pray to god to be heard, not onely for the blood of Chriſt, but alſo for the blood of the Martyres. Yea of Thomas Becket, which was no Martyr, but iuſtlie put to death for his inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctreaſon. Yea they teach that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt alſo be his owne Sauiour, that is, merit his ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his own good works, ſo that whereas the Scripture teacheth vs, that a man is onelie iuſtified and ſaued by a true and liuelie faith in Chriſt Ieſus, Poperie teacheth that a man is iuſtified not by ſuch a faith alone, but alſo by workes partlie of himſelfe, and partly of other.</p>
               <p>4 So the Scripture teacheth that Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is a perfect Sauiour, which hath redeemed vs from all iniquitie, and that with once offring vp of himſelfe, once I ſay for all and for euer, but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14153:31"/> popery teacheth, that he hath onely ſatisfied for ſinnes before Baptiſme, and that he muſt dailie be offred vp, by the hands of ſome greaſie prieſt. The Scripture teacheth, that there is certainely no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus, that they that loue the brethren are of the truth, and ſhal before him aſſure their hearts, that they ſhall neuer periſh out of the handes of Chriſt Ieſus, &amp;c, but poperie teacheth that it is preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſay that he is aſſured of theſe things. The Scripture teacheth vs that Chriſt his humanitie is in heauen, and ſhalbe in heauen till his ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto iudgement, but popery teacheth vs that it is euen now vpon the earth, &amp; that in manie places at one and the ſame time. The Scripture teacheth vs, that Chriſt his bodie glorified doth ſo retaine the eſſentiall qualities of a true bodie, that it may be diſcerned to haue both fleſh &amp; bones by our outward ſenſes. Luk. 24. 39. But poperie teacheth that it is ſo altered and chaunged, that neither by ſight nor by taſte nor by touching and feeling it can be diſcerned to haue any more fleſh and bone, then a peece of bread, yea then a wafer cake, as thinne as a paper. The Scripture forbiddeth all grauen or painted Images of any thing whatſoeuer and whereſoeuer to be made and worſhiped, or anie waies religiouſly to be bowed vnto, but popery commaundeth the making and worſhipping of Images of things in heauen, and in earth, mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and ſpirituall, viſible and inuiſible, knowne and vnknowne, liuing, and without life, euen of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14153:32"/> the materiall and woodden croſſe of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Scripture forbiddeth all detraction from, and all addition vnto it ſelfe, binding this prohibition with a commination of a fearefull curſe, to anie that ſhall ſo doe: but poperie hath not feared to cut of the whole ſecond commaundement, and many other thinges, neither to adde whole bookes to the Cannon of the Scriptures. The Scripture condemneth all praiers of the mouth in anie vnknowne tongue without vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and affection: but poperie teacheth that in praier, and all other things <hi>opus operatum, the worke done,</hi> howſoeuer it be done, with affection or without affection, is meritorious: and that all praiers of all perſons, and in al places muſt be in the latine tongue, albeit they that pray vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand neuer a word and may as well be taught to ſay O Deuill which art in hell, as Our father which art in heauen, yea and ſo they oftentimes pray for ought they knowe to the contrary. For howſoeuer the Pope hath canonized Thomas Becket, &amp; (as it is ſaid) Edmund Campian, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that traiterous neſt for Saints: yet their treaſons for which they were iuſtly cut off by the ſword of the ciuill magiſtrate and their damnable hereſies, and horrible blaſphemies whereof they ſhewed no repentance, doe rather condemne them for diuells in hell, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them for Saints in heauen. The Scriptures commend the obſeruation of the Lord his day aboue all other daies, condemning alſo the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of any other day in like ſort perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14153:32"/> but poperie commandeth more holidaies now then were euer commanded by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the time of the law, and that to be kept as ſtrictly as the Lords daie it ſelfe. The ſcripture teacheth, that al things are cleane to the cleane, but poperie maketh ſuch difference of meates, drinkes, apparell, &amp;c. and teacheth that at ſome times all fleſh is polluted, that it defileth who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer eateth thereof, more then ſwearing, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and ſuch like things, as God himſelfe hath expreſſely forbidden. The Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth to gather vp the baſeſt of God his creatures, that nothing be loſt: but poperie commandeth vpon Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o vtterly loſt, rather then ſaued for the good of any man. The Scripture teacheth vs onely to call vpon God in the dare of our trouble, and to praie onely to him when we may call, <hi>Our Father which art in heauen:</hi> but poperie teacheth vs to pray to the virgin Marie, Saint Peter, Saint Iohn, Saint Swithin, &amp;c. yea to the eyes, noſe, mouth, &amp;c. to the necker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiffe, girdle, &amp;c. of the virgin Marie; as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by ſome of their olde printed praier bookes. The Scripture teacheth by ſentence, and example of Prieſts, Leuites, Prophets, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, &amp;c. that marriage is honourable in all men, though as holy as Adam was before his fall: but poperie teacheth vs that at ſometimes of the yeare marriage is vnlawfull for all men, and at all times for the miniſters of the word in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14153:33"/> regard of their holy function. The Scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs that euery ſoule ought to be ſubiect to the higher power, and to honour the King, &amp;c, and that whoſoeuer reſiſteth ſuch power, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the ordinance of God: but poperie teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs that the cleargie is exempted from all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill power, and may not be called before any ſuch magiſtrates, neither be puniſhed by any ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill laws. To finiſh this argument drawne from the repugnancie of the matter of poperie to the Scriptures and that religion which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, I muſt euen ſay as the Apoſtle ſaith, Heb. 11. 23. <hi>What ſhall I ſay more? the time would be to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But poperie preſcribeth ſuch a carnall and fleſhly forme and manner of worſhip, as if God were all fleſh and no ſpirit. God oftentimes commaundeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be worſhipped onely according to his owne word. And truly if Princes may lawfully require obedience and ſeruice of their ſubiects according to their owne lawes, with much more equitie may God the Prince of princes require ſeruice according to his owne ſtatutes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Therefore he doth iuſtly refuſe the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, precepts, and doctrines of men in his worſhip, Iſa. 29. 13. Math. 15. 3. and in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places doth he alſo condemne wil worſhip, and ſuch as is forged onely in the forge of man his wit: but poperie preſcribeth a forme of God his worſhippe principally according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of men, and leaſt of all according to the doctrine of God himſelfe. Yea to ſpeake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to truth, they haue brought ſuch a darke cloud of the precepts of men into the worſhip of God, that a man can hardly diſcerne whether
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14153:34"/> they worſhip God according to any of his owne precepts. Yea to ſpeake yet more plaine, they make ſo many images, croſſes, reliques of ſaints, they make ſo many praiers to Saints, and offer ſo many gifts vnto them, they haue ſo many pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages in their honour, they repoſe ſo much truſt and confidence in all theſe things, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſo much coſt vpon them, they ſo preciſely and ſuperſtitiouſly obſerue daies conſecrated vnto them, &amp;c. that a man cannot well ſaie that they worſhip God in any manner at all. As for their fooliſh diſtinction digged onely out of that colepit, from whence they haue digged their Images, reliques, and inuocation of Saints, &amp;c. as none of their learned ſort haue euer bene able to defend it, ſo not one of fiue thouſand of the vulgar people doe know or vnderſtand it. How then can they regard it, or tell when they giue that vnto God, which they giue vnto ſaints, and images, &amp;c. or that to theſe things, which they ſhould by their owne doctrine onely giue vnto God.</p>
               <p>2 Neither doe they onely worſhippe theſe things, but alſo a peece of bread, which as ſoone as they haue adored, goeth into the mouth, from their mouth into the ſtomacke, from the ſtomacke into the paunch, and from the paunch out againe of the bodie, all men know whither. That this is ſo (whatſoeuer the ignorant are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to the contrarie) is manifeſt, becauſe that if a man were driuen to that neceſſitie, that he had no other meate to eate then their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14153:34"/> hoſt (as they call it,) as ſometime Dauid was forced to eate of the ſhewbread, I am ſure they could not denie, but that their hoſt ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for a weeke or a moneth together would nouriſh the naturall man as well as other bread; ſo as that their ſhould be as good digeſtion, and egeſtion of that, as alſo of other bread or meate: if it be ſo, can the nature of it be ſo altered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their doctrine, and by their inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſorceries, as that there ſhould remaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but accidents of bread? It is moſt abſurd, it is moſt ridiculous. For how can meere acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents nouriſh a materiall ſubſtance, and make a materiall egeſtion? If they ſaie that all this is done by the ſubſtance of Chriſt his very bodie, they ſpeake the more groſſely, in making that foode for this natural life, and the more blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly in ſaying that that goes into the draught. Againe, in ſuch a caſe I demand alſo, whether a man forced to liue onely by ſuch meanes for a time, or ſo liuing voluntarily by getting ſome way or other all the Hoſts to himſelfe in a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, could liue by them alone without drinke? Certenly by their doctrine, for the adminiſtring of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in one kind onely, it ſhould be ſo. For they ſay that one kind onely is ſufficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the blood of Chriſt is alwaies with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>per concomitantiam.</hi> So then, by this reaſon a man that ſhould haue nothing but their hoſt for a weeke or moneth, or longer time to liue vpon, ſhould not onely haue meate, but alſo drinke. For they muſt as wel gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the blood of Chriſt to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14153:35"/> be ſufficient to quench thirſt, as his fleſh to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie hunger. Yet for all this, let one of them trie but ſo litle a time to liue in this manner, I meane onely feeding vpon nothing but vpon breade conſecrated by ſome Papiſt, and I doubt not but that he will be glad to aske his neighbour a cup of ſome other drinke beſide that ſpiritual drinke which he hath by concomitance (as they ſpeak) of his foode. Yea if ſome Papiſt would trie this way, to liue but a little while, he ſhould quickly finde the knauerie of tranſubſtantiation, and conſequently alſo the impietie of all poperie.</p>
               <p>3 Nowe to returne from whence we haue made this digreſſion, the Papiſts doe not onely worſhip the croſſe, reliques, and ſuch like things; but ſuch as are no reliques of the Saints, &amp; pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of woode in ſtead of peeces of the croſſe whereon Chriſt was nailed. For if ſo many Churches ſhould haue ſuch large thongs of the very croſſe of Chriſt as the Papiſts ſay they haue, all gathered together would load the beſt ſhippe in England: then no maruaile indeede though Chriſt were wearie of bearing his croſſe, &amp; what a gyant was Simon of Syrene whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to beare ſuch a burthen? O, ſay they, you doe not vnderſtand the myſterie. For the croſſe of Chriſt was not ſo heauie, as al the peeces now laid together would be. How ſo? becauſe euer as one peece was cut off, the remainder did grow to the former greatnes, and was neuer a whit leſſe then at the firſt, but notwithſtanding all the peeces cut off, it ſtill remaineth whole. Let him
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14153:35"/> that liſt beleeue this; my name is Thomas, and I will not beleeue it, till I ſee it, therefore I ſhall neuer beleeue it. Touching their worſhip of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, he that will haue ſport, let him read M. Caluin of that matter; I meane his little booke of reliques: where amongſt other reliques, he ſhall finde Chriſt his foreskinne cut off when he was circumciſed, his ſhooes, the earth that laie vnder his feete, when he raiſed vp Lazarus from the dead, the title ſet ouer his head at his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, his thornie crowne, the diſh wherein he did eate the paſchall lambe, the napkin about his head when he was buried; yea the very taile of the aſſe whereon he rode, and many ſuch morſels.</p>
               <p>4 By theſe things hitherto ſpoken, we ſee how contrarie poperie is vnto the religion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Scriptures, both in matter and alſo in forme. Who therefore that knoweth the conſtant, immutable, and ſpirituall nature of God can be perſwaded in any reaſon, that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie ſhould be acceptable vnto God? If out of one fountaine cannot come both ſweete and ſowre waters, can two religions ſo contrarie come from one and the ſame God? If God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue that religion which is commended in the Scriptures, then he muſt needes diſalow of that which is contrarie thereunto: or if he allow of that religion which is contrarie to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then he muſt alſo diſallow of the religion commended in the Scriptures. If therefore no man dare thinke that God diſalloweth of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14153:36"/> commended in the ſcriptures, let no man dare to thinke that he alloweth poperie ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie thereunto. Now as touching our religion, both matter and forme agree with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. We commend knowledge, we commend and teach all that the ſcriptures commend and teach, we ſaie alſo and prooue by moſt ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent arguments that the Scriptures are ſufficient of themſelues, and conteine all things pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the worſhippe of God and ſaluation of men. Therefore alſo ſo nigh as we can, we frame the manner of our worſhip of God according onely to the Scriptures. If therefore the matter of the Scriptures, if the forme of God his worſhip, preſcribed in the ſcriptures be acceptable vnto God, then alſo is our religion: but the former cannot be denied, therefore alſo the latter muſt be graunted.</p>

                  <hi>Vnto him</hi> (that is, vnto God) <hi>be praiſe in the Church by Christ Jeſus, throughout all generations for euer.</hi> Eph. 3. 20, 21. And againe, <hi>Vnto God euen our father be praiſe for euermore, Amen.</hi> Phil. 4. 20.

And again, <hi>To God onely wiſe our Sauiour be glorie and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.</hi> Iud. 25. So alſo the Angels gaue glorie and honour and thankes to him that ſate vpon the throne, Rev. 4. 9. All creatures alſo in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and on earth, and vnder the earth, and in the ſea, and all that are in them did Iohn heare to ſay, <hi>Praiſe, and honour, and glorie, and power, be vnto him that ſitteth vpon the throne, which liueth for euer and euer.</hi> Revel. 5. 13. Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like teſtimonies of ſcripture there are in the ſame booke, in the pſalmes and elſwhere,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14153:37"/> teaching that all things are to be referred to the glorie of God, and that this glorie of God ſhould be the principall ende of all things, and that nothing ſhould be done but that whereby God might be glorified. Matth. 5. 16. This is likewiſe manifeſt by reaſon: becauſe God hath made all things, ruleth all things, and all things hold of him, and ſerue vnder him: therefore it followeth that all things ſhould ſeeke his praiſe and glorie aboue all things, and referre all things thereunto.</p>
               <p>2 Now what doth poperie? doth it thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect God his glorie in all things? doth it referre all things thereunto? Nothing leſſe: what with inuocation of Saints, and truſting in them, what with making images and worſhipping of them, what with giuing of the Pope the name of god, the headſhip of the Church, power to forgiue ſinnes, to let out of purgatorie, to command the deuills in hell, to open heauen gates, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying him accordingly, what with turning of bread into the bodie of Chriſt, and adoring the ſame, what with commending the free will of man, and teaching his abilitie and ſtrength to keepe the commandements of God, what with the doctrine of the blood of Martyrs, of merits, and of works ſupererogatorie, what (I ſay) with theſe, and other the like things, they aſcribe ſo much to theſe things, and ſo much reſpect the praiſe, honour, and glorie of theſe things, that they doe nothing almoſt for the glorie of God. Therefore they may ſay, if they would ſpeake
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14153:37"/> truly and according to their doctrine, and all their practiſe. <hi>Not vnto thy name, O Lord, not vnto thy name,</hi> yea they may adde the third time, <hi>Not vnto thy name giue the glorie, but unto ſaints, vnto Pope, vnto bread, vnto Martyrs, vnto vs.</hi> If they will yet ſay, that all theſe things make to the glorie of God, let them ſhew how &amp; which waies, and what glorie God hath by them. Our Sauiour Chriſt, Ioh. 7. 18. ſaith thus of and for himſelfe, <hi>He that speaketh of himſelfe, ſeeketh his owne glorie: but he that ſeeketh the glorie of him that ſent him is true, and no vnrighteouſnes is in him.</hi> In theſe words he prooueth himſelfe to be true and free from vnrighteouſnes, becauſe he ſought the glorie of God that had ſent him: and on the contrarie, that he that ſeeketh his owne glorie ſpeaketh of himſelfe, and is not ſent of God. This may be well applied againſt Pope and poperie. For our Sauiour ſpeaketh as well generally, as of himſelfe. The Pope therefore ſeeking his owne glorie and not the glorie of him by whome he ſaith he is ſent, doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly condemne himſelfe to ſpeake of himſelfe, and not to be ſent by him of whom he boaſteth. Poperie likewiſe ſeeking the glorie of it ſelfe, and of other things not of God, doth alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraie it ſelfe not to be of God, nor acceptable vnto God.</p>
               <p>3 As for our religion it aſcribeth nothing to Saints or any other thing, neither to our ſelues, but all to God. Our doctrine and whole religion abaſeth all things, yea our ſelues alſo, and all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14153:38"/> that is in vs, acknowledging that we haue no power in our ſelues, and of our ſelues, to doe, ſpeake, or thinke any thing that is good, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing alſo our ſelues to be full of all euill naturally, and prone to all ſinne and wickednes; teaching that what good ſoeuer is in vs, it is onely of God, and that no good thing is euer perfect whilſt here we liue: further alſo profeſſing that whatſoeuer good we doe, we merite nothing thereby at God his hands: but that God for all that, if he would deale with vs according to our vnworthines, might moſt iuſtly caſt vs out of his preſence for euer. Thus, I ſaie, doth our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion teach, and thus we freely confeſſe, and with heart and tongue we ſaie, <hi>Not vnto vs, O Lord, not vnto vs, but vnto thy name giue the glory.</hi> Therefore as this was a good argument for Chriſt, thereby to approoue himſelfe to be ſent from God; ſo alſo it is as good and firme for iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying and approouing of our religion to be of God, becauſe it ſeeketh the glorie of God. Thus much for the ende of Poperie.</p>

As therfore Poperie teacheth doctrine contrarie to the ſcriptures, ſo the fruits of poperie cannot be agreeable to them. Such as their doctrine is, ſuch muſt be their fruits: becauſe their doctrine is euill and contrarie to ſcriptures, therefore their fruits can not be good and ſutable to the ſcriptures. Many indeede teach good doctrine, that beare not fruits agreeable, but where the doctrine is euill, there are neuer any other then euill fruits. To begin with the practiſe of the commandements of the firſt table, it is certaine that they make no conſcience or account at all of them. Their ſtrait obſeruation of the precepts of men in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worſhip, hath iuſtled all care of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God cleane out of the dores.

Now beſides theſe things, their other fruits doe further bewraie that they haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde at all of any thing, that God himſelfe in his firſt table concerning his worſhippe doth command. For what Papiſt careth for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique hearing or priuate reading of the word of God, except it be onely to gather ſome colour of matter, either for the confirming and harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelues in their errours, as alſo the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating themſelues the more boldly to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the word in other things (as all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked doe:) or for the railing on our religion?

               <p>3 To ſuch as they account Saints in the ſame their printed <hi>portuus,</hi> thus they praie as followeth. To one S.

Sebaſtian, that they may merit to goe free and vnhurt of the plague. To S. Chriſtopher, to be comforted in mind and releaſed of all griefe. To S.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14153:41"/> In all theſe things doe we not ſee how they aske thoſe things of their Saints, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long onely to God to worke, and to beſtow?

Nay verely I am perſwaded that if many that haue ignorantly with great deuotion ſaid and ſung theſe words, had vnderſtoode the meaning of them, they would haue abhorred both them and all pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for them long ere this time. This ſhall be ſufficient touching their blaſphemies, whereby they haue moſt deepely tranſgreſſed the thirde commandement. Concerning the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, how can they ſanctifie the ſabbath according thereunto, ſith (as we haue ſhewed before) they haue not onely made many other holidaies equall vnto it, but alſo aduanced and magnified many aboue it.</p>
               <p>5 This ſhall ſuffice touching their fruits of the firſt table. Now becauſe the ſecond table is ſo ioyned with the firſt, that the one cannot be neglected or contemned without neglect and contempt of the other: becauſe the obſeruation of the duties of the ſecond is alſo ſometime cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of religion, Iam. 1. 17. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Papiſts doe moſt of all boaſt of their good workes in obſeruation of ſome things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſecond table, I will therefore alſo take a ſuruey, and giue the reader a ſight of their obedience thereunto, that thereby he may the better iudge of their religion.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:14153:43"/>
               <p>Here in the firſt place let be conſidered the intollerable pride of him whome poperie and Papiſts account the Head of their church: let, I ſaie, his pride be conſidered againſt men, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath beene noted againſt God. For how can he that lifteth himſelfe aboue God, or at the leaſt matcheth himſelfe in all things with God, make any account of men? This pride of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt men is ſo well knowne to all, that fewe words thereof will ſuffice. For how doth he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the ambaſſadours of all Princes ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, or any other that goe to ſee his holines? what curteſie doth he ſhew them? Forſooth he vouchſafeth nothing vnto them, but onely the kiſſing of his filthie foote. Therefore if the Earle of Wylſhire his dogge at the holding forth of the Pope his foote to be kiſſed of ſome there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, had bitten it cleane off, as he ranne &amp; took it into his mouth, had he not beene as worthie thereof as Iezabel was to be wholly eaten and deuoured of dogges? How alſo doth his pride appeare in riding vpon mens ſhoulders, as thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the earth too baſe for his princely foote to tread thereon, and all other creatures almoſt too vyle to beare his diuine perſon? What ſhall we ſay alſo of his triple crowne of moſt pure golde ſet with all pretious ſtones, not like to the thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie crowne that Chriſt did weare, but farre paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the diademes of all other Princes? yea what further ſhall we ſay of his monſtrous abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Emperours from time to time, when they were greater then now they are? Hath he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14153:44"/> not made them with their wiues and children to waite many daies togither at his court gates, as if they had beene beggers at ſome rich man his dore, crauing an almes of ſome ſmall peece of ſiluer, or of bread and cheeſe? Hath he not ſent them whither it pleaſed himſelfe, to doe their penance inioyned by him? Hath he not commanded them what ſeruice he would, as if they had not onely beene his pages, but alſo his lackies? Hath he not commanded them to hold his ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yrrop, and rewarded them with a blow on the eare for holding the wrong ſtyrrop? Hath he not troad on their necks? hath he not crowned them with his feete? will any doubt of theſe things becauſe they are reported by M. Fox in the booke of Martyrs? Let him knowe that M. Fox hath theſe things out of the bookes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen of their owne religion, which haue written more largely of theſe things then M. Fox could do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. So it pleaſed God to haue the memoriall of his intollerable pride preſerued by his owne brood, that the poſteritie might make the leſſe doubt thereof. Againe, what ſhall I ſaie of the right which he chalengeth to himſelfe for aduancing and depoſing, for ſetting vp and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe Kings and Princes at his pleaſure? what ſhall I ſaie of thoſe bulls, excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and helliſh (but yet fooliſh) thunder bolts againſt the Lord his annointed ouer vs, for the curſing of her Maieſties owne perſon, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging all her ſubiects of all obedience vnto her? what ſhall I ſaie of the continuall debate,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14153:44"/> contention, ſtrife, and warres which alwaies he hath made betwixt Princes? May this fellow truly ſaie as our Sauiour ſaith, Matth. 11. 29. <hi>Learne of me, for I am meeke and lowly in heart?</hi> Nay rather he may truly ſaie, <hi>Take heede of me, for I am proud and haughtie in heart.</hi> May he alſo ſaie as the Prophet Dauid ſaith, Pſal. 131. <hi>Lord, mine eyes are not haughtie, neither are mine eyes loftie, &amp;c?</hi> Nay rather alſo he may make a cleane contrarie hymne to be ſung in a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie tune. Saint Peter whoſe ſucceſſour he vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe, commaunded all men to <hi>ſubmit themſelues to Kings and to honour them,</hi> 1. Pet. 2. 13, and 17. But he commandeth all Kings to ſubmit themſelues to him, and to honour him. Saint Peter beeing iuſtly reprehended by Saint Paul, Galat. 2. 14. did patiently take the ſame reprehenſion, and after that wrote neuertheleſſe of Saint Paul, 2. Pet. 3. 15. But the Pope to preuent all ſuch reprehenſions, and to ſtoppe the mouthes of all men, that no man may dare to finde any fault with him, chalengeth this as a ſpeciall prerogatiue (as we haue heard before) that no man may ſaie vnto him, Why doſt thou ſo?</p>
               <p>6 That which hath bin ſaid of him, may alſo be ſaid of his Cardinalls, Biſhops, &amp; other of his traine, <hi>Like maſter, like man.</hi> They are all of one broode, of the ſame nature, of the ſame ſpirite. Such alſo as the Pope himſelfe is, ſuch haue bin many of his whelps here in England. From whom haue all treaſons come, all inſurrections,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14153:45"/> all rebellions, all conſpiracies againſt her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties perſon, &amp; the whole ſtate of the land? Haue they not come from Ieſuits, Seminary prieſts, and (as they call them) catholique noble-men and gentlemen? It cannot be denied. What alſo ſhall we ſay of the murther of the late French king by a Iacobine fryer, and of other like practiſes of the Papiſts againſt their Soueraignes in other countries? Can the Proteſtant be iuſtly charged with any ſuch things againſt their princes though popiſh? As for that of the Duke of Suffolke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Queene Marie, as it was before the title of Queene Marie was thoroughly knowne, ſo all men know what colour of reaſon he had to doe as he did, by the will and teſtament of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prince king Edward the ſixth. Beſides it is alſo knowne how ſoone and willingly he yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelfe. As for the Ladie Iane how inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſhee was in that action, the Chronicles of our land doe teſtifie. Touching Sir Thomas Wyat, he intended no hurt againſt the perſon of Queene Marie, but by his oath to the will and teſtament of king Henrie the eight, thinking himſelfe bound to doe whatſoeuer he could for the hindring of all forraine gouernment, he did therefore withſtand the comming in of the Spanyard. Concerning the late tumult of Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and his two aſſociates, as Hacket himſelfe was iuſtly executed, ſo the other two were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of all men in that behalfe: and therefore all men ſee how farre this differeth from the continuall practiſes and heynous treaſons of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14153:45"/> Papiſts, allowed and iuſtified in their open wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as appeareth by Cardinall Allin his booke of that matter, and likewiſe approoued &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Pope himſelfe, the head (as they ſay) of their Church.</p>
               <p>7 To leaue this 5. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, let vs come to the next, wherein the Lord forbiddeth all cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, and commandeth all mercie, as likewiſe he doth in many other places. Doe they therefore (I meane the Pope and Papiſts as they are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts) behaue themſelues any better in obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this commaundement, then all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? No certenly: but ſuch as their pride is, ſuch is their crueltie. As the Scripture oftentimes ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth theſe two euills togither, ſo alſo they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in them. For it may be truly ſaide of them as the Prophet writeth of his time, pſal. 73. 6. <hi>Pride is as a chayne vnto them, and crueltie coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them as a garment.</hi> This is manifeſt by that which hath beene before ſpoken of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quution of the Proteſtants in our owne land, of the Maſſacre in France, of the Spaniſh inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the diſpenſations graunted by the Pope for the murthering of her Maieſtie, and of the villanous killing of the French king. For further proofe alſo of the crueltie of the <hi>Catholike Prince the king of Spayne,</hi> in all thoſe places where he raigneth by right or wrong, by inheritance or violence and vſurpation, I referre the reader to the late booke of the intertainment of Engliſh fugitiues by the Spanyard. In this booke the Spaniſh crueltie is both largely deſcribed, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14153:46"/> alſo exactly penned. Therefore this booke bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo lately come forth, and handling this matter ſo well, I doe onely referre the reader hereunto. Yea the Papiſts haue not onely beene cruell to the liuing but alſo to the deade. For doe not all men know that they digged vp the bones of Bucer and Paulus Phagius, ſommoned them beeing dead long before, to appeare in their Court, and condemned them, and at laſt buried their bones ſolemnely at Cambridge? Did they not alſo digge vp the bodie of one Margaret Elyot that had died in priſon, did they not (I ſaie) digge vp her bodie, after that it was buried three or foure daies, and ſo burnt the ſame? Is ſuch crueltie a note of that religion that is acceptable to him that hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his children to be mercifull as himſelfe is mercifull?</p>
               <p>Touching the ſeauenth commandement, not to ſpeake of the filthie adulteries, fornications, inceſts, and ſuch like abominations of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, euen of their Cardinalls &amp; Biſhops, whereof ſome haue beene taken in adulterie, the next night after they haue much inueighed againſt the marriage of miniſters; others haue beene taken in ginnes as they haue climed win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, to defile other mens wiues: yea not to ſpeake of the like filthines of the Pope his owne holines, that hath beene taken in the very acte of adulterie, and ſlaine at that very inſtant. Not (I ſaie) to ſpeake of theſe and other the like things, all the world knoweth that their whole
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14153:46"/> Church doth allowe Stewes, and houſes of bawdrie, where any man may haue his whore according to his abilitie to giue for them, ſome for twentie ſhillings, ſome for tenne ſhillings, ſome for tenne groates, yea for ſixe pence. Any olde men that knew the Stewes here in our owne lande at London, and all trauellers into other countreies, can witneſſe theſe thinges. I feate alſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trauellers knowe the trueth of theſe things too much. The Apoſtles condemne all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and wantonneſſe: yea they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the Church not to ſuffer one ſuch filthie perſon amongſt them, leaſt by one many be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed and made to fall from the grace of God, 1. Cor. 5. 4, &amp;c. Hebr. 12. 16. How much leſſe then ſhould the Church ſuffer whole houſes, and great companies of many harlots? Hither alſo appertaine the abhominable diſpenſations that the Pope hath graunted for vnlawefull &amp; inceſtuous marriages, contrarie to the written worde of God, yea and to very nature it ſelfe: the which alſo he might as well haue graunted for the marriage of a man with a beaſt. Can all theſe things ſo contrarie to the expreſſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, be ſaide to be done by that ſpirit, by inſpiration whereof the Scriptures were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen?</p>
               <p>9 To come to the eight commandement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theft &amp; all iniuſtice againſt our neighbour in his goods, they offend as much herein as in the former. For by what authoritie or right
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14153:47"/> doth the Pope himſelfe, his Cardinalls, Biſhops, Abbots, Pryors, Monks, Fryers, Prieſts, Canons, Peticanons, and other of his generation, gather ſuch great maſſes and infinite ſummes of money of all ſorts of people as they doe? For what doe they either for ſoule or bodie worthy any thank? much leſſe worthie ſo great and ample reward. The King of Spayne alſo the Pope his eldeſt ſonne, yet not his heyre, though his fellow heyre of the blacke and darke kingdome, by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie or right or colour of either, or of both, hath he by his force and violence gotten all thoſe forraigne kingdomes which he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and which he holdeth as vniuſtly as he hath got them? But what neede I thus to accuſe the perſons of the Pope and papiſts of the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this commaundement? their religion it ſelfe eſpecially at the wel-ſpring thereof, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether couetouſnes. It is an olde ſaying, that <hi>Omnia venalia Romae:</hi> and this ſaying though it be old, yet is it not moldie or caſt away by them, but freſh, and as it were new baked, and therfore as much ſet by, and as much fedde vpon by the daintieſt mouthes amongſt them as euer it was: yea many of them that thinke ſcorne of much other good and daintie meate, doe feede of this as ſauourly and hungerly as if they had not had a good meales meat an whole yeare before. But I forget my ſelfe to ſpeake of their perſons, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I charged their religion of couetouſnes. I ſaie therefore that couetouſnes is the foode and the very life of poperie. For in poperie what is not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14153:47"/> to be bought for money? To omit the common ſale of all their preferments, euen of the pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it ſelfe, who knoweth not that maſſes, dirges, trentalls, forgiuenes of ſinnes, releaſe from Purgatorie, and heauen it ſelfe, (as poperie maketh men beleeue) may be had for money? Hence it is that the former generall prouerbe, <hi>All things are to be ſold at Rome,</hi> hath brought forth another in wordes more particular, but in ſenſe and meaning as large and generall, <hi>No penie, no pater noſter:</hi> whereby is ſignified, that in poperie the very leaſt thing is not to be had <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iis,</hi> that is, freely and without money: and no maruaile, for ſith they teach, that God himſelfe giueth not heauen freely, and without merits, why ſhould their religion giue the commodity it hath without ſiluer? Neither in poperie may a man haue onely pardon for any ſinne commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but alſo a diſpenſation and licenſe for the committing and doing of any thing, how wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vniuſt ſoeuer it be, as hath bin touched before. How contrarie is this manner of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as well to the practiſe of holy men in the ſcriptures, as to the other doctrine of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Eliſha refuſed the gift of Naaman, offered and vrged vpon him, though Naaman had firſt recouered his health by the meanes of Eliſha. The Pope taketh where nothing is offered, and for which nothing is performed. S. Peter alſo beeing offered money by Simon the ſorcerer, for power that on whome ſoeuer he did laie his hand, he might receiue the holy Ghoſt, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14153:48"/> with great indignation, <hi>Thy money periſh with thee, &amp;c.</hi> Act. 8. 20. The Pope is not onely readie to ſell greater matters for money, then thoſe gifts of the holy Ghoſt, or at the leaſt to take money for words onely of greater matters; but alſo is ſo greedie to ſell them, that he will rage and roare like a lyon, if money be not offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnasked, or not preſently paide as ſoone as it is demanded. Can we therefore thinke that the Pope taketh all ſuch things by the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wherby Eliſha and Peter refuſed that which they might haue had with very good will? Nay, but moſt fitly may he be compared to the true daughters of the horſeleach, which crie, <hi>Giue, giue:</hi> as alſo to the three things that will not be ſatisfied, and to the fourth, that ſaie not it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, &amp;c. Prov. 30. 15, and 16. The great Almes that houſes of popiſh religion doe giue, are but ſleights of the Deuill to bleare mens eies withall, that they may not ſee the miſerable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes of ſuch houſes in other matters, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their other wickednes, but that they ſhould rather thinke them to be liberall and good, how couetous and wicked ſoeuer they be. Further ſuch almes are falſly called by the name of libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, becauſe they are without difference of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon, whither needie or not needie, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able to get their liuing by labour or not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and ſo are they the mothers of idlenes, and the grandmothers of many other wickedneſſes. The theefe alſo that robbeth on the high waie, or that breaketh vp mens houſes by ſuch means
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14153:48"/> getting many rich booties, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde alſo franckly ſpendeth that which he hath ſo lewdly gotten at ale-houſes and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes, vpon harlots, vpon good fellowes, or vpon ſome poore perſons; may as well bragge of his franckneſſe, and boaſt of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie, thereby to iuſtifie his theft, as theſe may obiect their almes for defence of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes.</p>
               <p>10 Touching the ninth commaundement, firſt popery accounteth them for heretikes, that hold nothing but the word of God. The Papiſts alſo (I meane the learned papiſts) ſticke not to belie the dead, as well as the liuing, boaſting all the Fathers to be on their ſide, that are more againſt them then for them, making them alſo to ſaie that which they neuer ſpake, as hath beene before ſhewed. Haue they not alſo caſt out libells againſt the moſt worthie ſeruants of God: Luther, Calvin, Beza, and ſuch like, full of all notorious ſlaunders, for the better diſgracing of their doctrine and religion? Yea in ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells they haue not ſpared Nobles and Princes themſelues. As for the laſt commaundement, we ſhall not neede to labour the detecting them therein. For howe can they haue any regard thereof, that flatly denie concupiſcence to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinne?</p>
               <p>11 Theſe things and many other doe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew the fruits of poperie to be ſuch, as that they flatly bewraie poperie not to be of God, if wee had no holy Scripture at all to direct our
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14153:49"/> iudgements, the light onely of nature would deſcrie poperie to be nothing agreeable to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature. He alſo that had ſeene no further into the inuiſible things of God then the works onely of God, doe ſhew them vnto him, Rom. 1. 20. He that had beheld no more of the glorie of God then the heauens and firmament ſhew forth the ſame: he that had heard no more then daie vnto daie and night vnto night doth vtter, Pſal. 19. 1, and 2. Finally, he that had learned no more of the power and goodnes of God then the beaſts can teach, then the foules of the ayre can tell, then the earth it ſelfe can ſhewe, and then the fiſhes of the ſea can declare vnto him, Iob 12. 7. and 8. may eaſily by theſe fruits iudge the tree that beareth them to be an euill tree, and ſuch as the Lord will one daie cut vp by the rootes, and caſt into the fire. M. Fox in the booke of Acts and Monuments reporteth, that one Rulmar and ſome other beeing Papiſts, ſeeing the extreame crueltie of other Papiſts in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuting the Proteſtants in the daies of Queene Marie, did thereby conceiue great diſlike of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, and became likewiſe from that time lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and profeſſours of the Goſpel. If one fruit of poperie were ſo effectuall in them, what ſhall be ſaide of thoſe that notwithſtanding the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonſtration of all thoſe fruits of poperie before mentioned, (more differing from the fruits of that religion which God commandeth in his word, then the ſoureſt crabbe doth from the daintieſt apple) doe not yet ſee the abomination
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14153:49"/> of poperie, neither haue any better affection to our religion then at the firſt.</p>
               <p>12 If againſt this that I haue written of theſe fruits, it be obiected, that all papiſts are not ſuch, but that ſome of them are modeſt, humble, loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to their Princes, gentle and mercifull, ſober and chaſt, iuſt and righteous touching the goods of their neighbours, yea remitting ſome part of their owne right, and if they be great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons dealing fauourably and kindly with their tenants, and ſuch as belong vnto them or hold of them: yea ſometimes better then ſuch as haue the name of Proteſtants, that they are alſo wiſe and circumſpect in their ſpeach of other: I acknowledge that theſe things are ſo indeede, and by ſome experience I ſpeake this to their commendation, and if I ſhould not ſo ſpeake, I ſhould doe them wrong: yet I anſwer firſt that ſuch examples are very rare, ſecondly that ſome of them of whome I ſpeake by experience are rather ſuſpected Papiſts, then perfect Papiſts, becauſe they refuſe not to heare the preaching of the word, from the which I truſt, that they learne theſe vertues, whereby I alſo hope, that a waie will be prepared for a better entrance of the Goſpell into their hearts, to the expelling of all dregges of poperie, if any remaine: and laſtly though all Papiſts bring not forth ſuch fruits, that yet ſome of them, doe but conceale them, &amp; force themſelues to the ſhew of theſe vertues to merit heauen by, and that all of them may be ſuch as before by thoſe fruits I haue deſcribed,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14153:50"/> for all poperie, or any thing taught by poperie to the contrarie. For if they be ſuch, poperie it ſelfe will not condemne them, but beare them out as well as it hath borne thoſe out, of whom before we haue ſpoken.</p>
               <p>13 But ſome man will yet further ſaie, if ye iudge according to this rule, then likewiſe may your religion be alſo condemned. For are here not amongſt you, O ye Proteſtants (that haue <hi>the Goſpell</hi> in your mouthes) many blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, many contemners of your owne ſermons and ſacraments, many proude, many cruell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, many adulterers and fornicatouts, many oppreſſours and extortioners, many backbiters and ſlanderers, &amp;c. To this I muſt needs ſay, that my heart grieueth, my bowells ake, mine eyes weepeth, my face bluſheth, my countenance changeth, my tongue ſtuttereth, and my hande trembleth, and I would my whole man were more troubled to ſpeake, and write the anſwer. For I muſt confeſſe and doe ingeniouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to Gods glorie, &amp; our owne ſhame, that we haue many ſuch as of whome the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection is made. But as yet, O ye Papiſts and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, ye alſo O ye Atheiſts, and that are of no religion, but deride all, (for I know that this is the common obiection of both ſorts of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries) know ye that this neither excuſeth pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, nor condemneth our religion. The reaſon in one worde is this, becauſe although many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs are of theſe ſinnes, expreſſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the ſcriptures, and contrarie alſo to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14153:50"/> our profeſſion, yet doth not our religion main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and allow them in their ſinnes: but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily it condemneth ſuch hypocrites, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that their iudgement in the latter daie ſhall be greater then the iudgement of Papiſts, and the heathen themſelues for the ſame ſinnes. But as for the like amongſt, O ye you Papiſts, you religion it ſelfe, and the head and pillars of your Church doe allow, approoue, and iuſtifie them: yea alſo commend ſome of theſe manifeſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of God his laws, as excellent vertues, and ſuch as whereby the tranſgreſſours ſhall merit heauen.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14153:51"/> neuer to be planted or grafted by the Lord. This fruit is the great ioy and ſound comfort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that alwaies groweth vpon the religion commended in the ſcriptures. <hi>The ſtatutes of the Lord</hi> (ſaith Dauid) <hi>are right, and reioyce the heart,</hi> Pſal. 19. 8. <hi>They are alſo ſweeter then honie, or the honie combe,</hi> v. 10. He ſaith alſo that the promiſe of God had beene his comfort in his trouble, and had quickned him, pſal. 119. 50. and that he remembred the ancient iudgements of God and ſo was comforted, v. 52. and againe, v. 92. that except the law of God had beene his delight he ſhould haue periſhed in his affliction. S. Peter alſo ioyneth theſe two religions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beleeuing in him whome we ſee not, and reioycing with ioy vnſpeakable and glorious, 1. Pet. 1. 8. And indeede how can this religion be without ſuch ioy and comfort? For it teacheth that the ſinnes of ſuch as doe beleeue according to the ſcriptures are forgiuen, Matth. 9. 2. that they are iuſtified and haue peace with God, Rom. 5. 1. that they ſhall neuer be caſt awaie, Joh. 6. 37. but raiſed vp at the latter daie, v. 44. that they are in the hands of Chriſt, and that no man ſhall take them out, but that they ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenly haue eternall life, Ioh. 10. 28. which eternal life is kept for them in heauen, as likewiſe they are kept for it in earth, not by men or angels, but by the mightie power of God, 1. Pet. 1 4, and 5. that they are tranſlated from death to life, 1. Ioh. 3. 14. and are of the truth, and doe as certenly know themſelues to be of the truth, and that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14153:51"/> therfore they ſhall before him aſſure their hearts, as God himſelfe greater then their hearts know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, v. 19, and 20. that they are borne of God, 1. Ioh. 4. 7. and therefore are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and heyres of God, and coheyres with Chriſt, Rom. 8. 17. and that nothing ſhall ſeparate them from the loue of God, v. 38. that they are ſo built vpon a rocke, that no ſtormes or tempeſts ſhall ouerthrow them, Math. 7. 25. but ſtand faſt for euer like vnto mount Zion, pſal. 125. 1. that they may no more doubt that God will forget the worke and labour of their loue, then they may doubt of the righteouſneſſe of God himſelfe, Heb. 6. 10. not in reſpect of their works, but in reſpect of his promiſe, 1. Ioh. 2. 25. and the price wherewith they are bought by Chriſt Ieſus. 1. Cor. 7. 23. and 1. Pet. 1. 9. and of the earneſt of their inheritance, euen the ſpirit, Eph. 1. 14. and of the continuall interceſſion of Chriſt for them at the right hand of God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Rom. 8. 34. Theſe and ſuch like things doth the Scripture aſſure all them of, that by the fruits of a true faith and religion both inward and outward, know that they haue true faith and religion. How therefore can they be heauie? yea how can they not reioyce with ioy vnſpeakable and glorious?</p>
               <p>2 But what ioy and comfort can there be in poperie? doth not poperie denie the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſound comfort, namely the doctrine of particular election, whereby a man is taught, that God loued him, and predeſtinated him to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14153:52"/> eternall ſaluation before the world was made? doth not poperie take awaie the word of God that giueth wiſdome to the ſimple, ſight to the blinde, light to them that ſit in darknes, and life to them that are dead in their ſinnes? and doth it not therefore leaue men fooliſh and blinde, in darknes and in death it ſelfe? Can there be any comfort in ſuch an eſtate? Doth not poperie teach that ſaluation is to be had partly, yea chiefely by our owne works and merits? And who knoweth when he hath wrought and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited enough? Doth not poperie teach that the efficacie of the ſacrament, dependeth vpon the intention of the prieſt? Who knoweth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of any man his heart but his owne? 1. Cor. 2. 11. who therefore knoweth when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth the ſacrament, and when he doth not? Doth not poperie teach, that it is preſumption for any man to ſaie that he is certen and ſure of the fauour of God, and his continuance therein, and of his ſaluation? What ſound and certen comfort can there be without aſſurance of theſe things?</p>
               <p>3 I graunt that the Papiſts reioyce and are merrie as other wicked men reioyce and are merrie. But ſuch ioy is fleſhly, ſuperficiall and vncertaine, the ground thereof beeing not in God but in themſelues, in Saints, in reliques of Saints, in the bloode of Martyrs, in the pardon and indulgences of the Pope, and ſuch like ſandie ſtuffe, and therefore not certaine. The ioy of the Papiſts is like the ioy of the Iſraelites
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14153:52"/> at the making and worſhipping of the calfe. Exod. 32. 6, 17, 18, and 19. The ioye of the Papiſts is the ioye of Nabal in his great feaſt, 1. Sam. 25. 36. The ioye of the Papiſts is like the ioye of Belſhazzar, when he made the great feaſt to a thouſand of his Princes, and dranke wine before the thouſand, commaunding the holy veſſells of the Temple of the Lord to be brought forth vnto that feaſt, and polluting them at his pleaſure. Dan. 5. 1. Euen ſuch, (I ſaie) and no other is the ioye of the Papiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Calfe, that is, before their innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable idols and grauen images, and at their ſolemne feaſtes which they dedicate to the honour and worſhippe of them and of their Saints.</p>
               <p>4 Contrariwiſe our religion teacheth all theſe thinges which before wee heard to be taught in the Scriptures, it teacheth men to applie them to themſelues, and by them to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelues of God his loue and fauour, as certenly as if the angel Gabriel were ſent to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he was to the Virgin Marie, euen to ſpeake to them particularly, as he ſpake to her and ſaide, Luk. 1. 28. <hi>Hayle,</hi> or (according alſo to the naturall ſignification of the word) reioyce and be merrie, <hi>as one that is freely beloued;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine whatſoeuer thy ſinnes be, &amp;c. yet feare not, for thou haſt found fauour with God, v. 30. as if alſo another ſhould ſaie as he did to the ſhepheards, Luk. 2. 10. <hi>Be not afraid: for behold, I bring you tidings of great ioye, that ſhall be to all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14153:53"/> people, &amp;c.</hi> This comfort and this ioy doth our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion teach and commend, and offer, yea alſo bring vnto all them that truly embrace the ſame. Yea certenly they that by the powerful working of our religion in their hearts, and in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conuerſation, doe know themſelues not to be hypocrites, but truly to haue embraced our religion and the doctrine thereof, they (I ſay) may better caſt away all feare, and more certenly aſſure themſelues of God his fauour, and therefore alſo more truly reioyce then all the Papiſts in the world, or any one of them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in his poperie may or might, not onely if one angel, but if all the angels in heauen ſhould come and ſpeake vnto them in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This is a great word, but it is a true word: how ſo? verily becauſe one greater then all the angels doth ſpeake it, and biddeth all ſuch not to feare, but to reioyce. God himſelfe generally thus ſpeaketh in all the Scriptures, to all ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally: and the holy Ghoſt his effectuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of true faith and true godlines in euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, that is, truly of our religion ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth alſo the ſame thing. Therefore the greater and more credible that the maſter is then the ſeruant, and ſo alſo God himſelfe, then the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which are but the worke of his hands, and therefore his ſeruants, and miniſtring ſpirits: the more certen alſo may euery one be aſſured of God his fauour, to whome God and his ſpirit by their effectuall working doe teſtifie the ſame, then if the angels of heauen ſhould ſpeake as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14153:53"/> much to one in whome were not the effects of the ſpirit. Further alſo the reaſon of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſpeach of the angels to Marie and the ſhepheards beeing well obſerued, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that which I haue ſaid of the applying of the ſame comfort to all thoſe that are truly of our religion. For why will the angel haue the virgin Marie not to feare? becauſe ſhee was freely beloued, and had found fauour with God: but how doth the angel prooue this? <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou ſhalt conceiue in thy vvombe, and beare a ſonne, and thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus.</hi> If therefore to conceiue in her wombe and beare this ſonne onely, were a ſufficient argument to perſwade her to caſt away feare, to reioyce, and aſſure her ſelfe that ſhee had found fauour with God, how much more may he caſt away feare, reioyce, and aſſure himſelfe of God his fauour, whoſe ſoule and whole man hath embraced whole Chriſt, &amp; is likewiſe embraced of Chriſt, and is made one with Chriſt, euen fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone, and which knoweth this by the death of ſinne, and the life of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes in him, through the death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt? If ſhee were ſo bleſſed whoſe wombe ſhould beare Chriſt according to the fleſh, and whoſe pappes ſhould giue him ſucke, how much more <hi>bleſſed are they that heare the word of God and keepe it?</hi> Luc. 11. 28.</p>
               <p>5 The like may be ſaide of the argument of the angel to the ſhepheards, for <hi>be not afraid,</hi> ſaith the angel: but why? <hi>I bring you trdings of great
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14153:54"/> ioye, that ſhall be to all people.</hi> What are theſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and what is this great ioye? <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you is borne this day in the city of Dauid, a Sauiour which is Chriſt the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Now if this were ſuch ioye to heare onely of the birth of Chriſt Ieſus, how much greater is it to heare of the birth of the whole life, of the death, of the reſurrection, of the aſcenſion, and of the ſitting of Chriſt Ieſus at the right hand of God, there making interceſſion for all his members? yea not onely to heare, but alſo to be aſſured of theſe things by the effects of them in our conſciences. Neither doth our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion onely bid men thus to reioyce for a time, and at a ſtart, but we ſaie alſo with the Apoſtle, <hi>Reioyce in the Lord alwaies: and againe I ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,</hi> Phil. 4. 4. But vpon what ground doth our religion bid men thus to reioyce? becauſe it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth them not onely of the preſent fauour of God, but alſo of the continuance thereof for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to them that are once truly incorporated into Chriſt Ieſus. For <hi>whome God loueth, he loueth to the ende,</hi> Ioh. 13. 1. and, <hi>the gifts of God are without repentance,</hi> Rom. 11. 29. and, <hi>in God is no change nor ſhadow of change,</hi> Iam. 1. 17. <hi>Neither is he as man, that he ſhould repent: hath he ſaide, and ſhall he not doe it? hath he ſpoken and ſhall he not accompliſh it?</hi> Num. 23. 19. And againe, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth ſhall paſſe, but the word of the Lord ſhall not paſſe, till all things be done.</hi> Luk. chap. 21. verſ. 33.</p>
               <p>6 Vpon theſe and many other the like grounds, we bidde them that truly haue embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14153:54"/> our religion to reioyce alwaies, and doe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them vpon the immutable nature of God, and of his word, that they ſhall neuer be caſt out of his fauour: yea that it is as poſſible for the power of hell to take away from Chriſt one of the members of his materiall bodie now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and raigning in heauen, as to plucke away or cut off any member of his myſticall and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bodie here in earth. Therefore of all ſuch &amp; euery ſuch we ſaie, that God ſpeaketh as Iſaac ſpake of Iaacob, after that he had one bleſſed him, <hi>I haue bleſſed him, therefore he ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> Gen. 27. 33. As Pilate alſo ſaith of the title and ſuperſcription, which he had ſet vpon the head of Ieſus Chriſt crucified, when the high Prieſts laboured him to alter the ſame, <hi>What I haue written, that I haue written,</hi> Ioh. 19. 22. So ſaie we of all them, whoſe names God hath once written and regiſtred in the booke of life; that (the decree of God, beeing like the decree of the Medes and Perſians, <hi>which altereth not,</hi> Dan. 6. 8.) though all the deuills in hell ſhould labour God for the raſing of any out of the booke of life, whoſe names are written therein, yea if it were poſſible, that all the bleſſed angels ſhould indeauour and intreat any ſuch thing, that God would alwaies keepe his purpoſe, and anſwer them, Him that <hi>I</hi> haue written, I haue written. This is the ioye and comfort of God his children, and this ioye and comfort is in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and neuer to be found in poperie or to be attained vnto thereby.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:14153:55"/>
               <p>7 If any obiect that many ſometime of our religion doe vtterly fall away, and ſometime alſo deſpaire for euer of the goodnes and fauour of God, I anſwer with S. Iohn, <hi>They went our from, vs, but they were not of vs,</hi> 1. Ioh. 2. 19. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed our religion, but they neuer truly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ſame, neither did euer truly feele the power of godlines in their ſoules; yea though it may be that they had ſome ioy in our religion, yet it was but the ioy of the ſtony ground, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſeede of the word hath no ſound rooting, Math. 13. 20. and like vnto the ioy of Herod at the preaching of Iohn Baptiſt, Mark. 6. 20. Yea but ſome perhaps will obiect further, that many of the beſt of our religion are often in great hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines of minde, and doe much doubt of God his fauour, &amp;c. yea that moſt part of their life they continue in this penſiuenes. To this <hi>I</hi> anſwer, that although this fruit of ioy and ſound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort do alwaies grow vpon the tree of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet ſometime the twigges of our olde crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocke into which this religion is grafted, doe grow out ſo farre through our euill husbandrie, and not pruning them in time, that the leaues thereof beeing very thicke, according to the nature of the crabbe, doe ſo ſhadowe this fruit, that euen he that is grafted with the impes and ſciences of our religion, can hardly finde this fruit without narow ſearch and diligent turning ouer, and remoouing the leaues as it were one by one with his hand. As alſo we read that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt were in the preſence of the two
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14153:55"/> diſciples that were going to Emaus and talked with them, and yet was not diſcerned by them, becauſe <hi>their eyes were holden, that they could not know him,</hi> Luk. 24. 16. as alſo that Marie Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene ſaw Ieſus and talked with him, but yet knew him not, Ioh. 20. 14. So alſo the children of God that by a true and liuely faith are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Chriſt, do not yet ſee Chriſt, nor the great comfort which they haue by Chriſt, becauſe their eyes are holden, that is, their ſight is dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ſight of ſinne partly, and partly alſo by the ſleights of Satan, that they can neither ſee nor feele that matter of ioy and comfort which they haue and carrie daily about within their breaſts.</p>
               <p>8 Finally touching this comfort, it is with the children of God, and ſuch as are truly of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as it is with many ſimple men in the world touching their earthly poſſeſſions and inheritances. For although they haue neuer ſo good right vnto them, and neuer ſo good aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them, euen as good as poſſibly they can haue, and as all the lawyers by all the law in the world can make them, yet for all that, they oftentimes meete with ſome pettifogger and couſening mate, that telleth them their title is naught and not worth a ſtraw, &amp; ſo forth. Now by ſuch wordes the ſimple man is halfe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and beginneth ſomething to doubt, yea ſometime almoſt to feare: and thus he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth till he meete with his learned counſaile, that doe againe declare vnto him and aſſure him of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14153:56"/> the contrarie: ſo, Iſaie, is it with the children of God, and ſuch as are truly ſeaſoned with our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. By Chriſt Ieſus they haue as good right to the kingdome of heauen as is poſſible, and their eſtate is ſo good as that all the enemies they haue either carnal or ſpirituall, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly defeat them thereof; notwithſtanding ſuch is their ſimplicitie in heauenly things (as oftentimes it is greater in earthly things) that their enemie and the enemie of God meeting with them, and reaſoning the caſe, either by his outward inſtruments, or by thoſe ſecret friends which he hath in a man his owne heart, doth at the laſt by his ſubtiltie make them to doubt, and filleth them with feare, till they meete againe with their old counſeller the ſpirit of God (who ſometime keepeth himſelfe cloſe, and for a time will not (as it were) be ſpoken withall, to trie what his clyents will or can doe without him) but when they meete and conferre with him, by the time that he hath a little repeated their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and declared their right from point to point by his ſeuerall effects in their hearts, and how alſo Chriſt Ieſus purchaſed ſaluation for them, and beſtowed it vpon them, and therefore alſo gaue him vnto them as an earneſt pennie thereof, to ſeale and confirme the whole gift; then doe they caſt away their former feare, and recouer their ancient comfort. So is it from time to time with them, whilſt Satan talketh with them, and the ſpirit of God hideth himſelfe, they doubt: but when the ſpirit of God talketh
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14153:56"/> with them, by his liuely and ſenſible operation in their hearts, then are they of good cheere and comfort; yet euen whilſt they feare, they haue no cauſe of feare, but their right is alwaies one and the ſame: onely ſometime by their ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie they ſee not their right. This ſhall ſuffice to haue ſpoken both of the abundance of all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly comfort in our religion, and alſo of the want thereof in poperie. Wherefore I doe againe conclude, both that our religion is moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and acceptable vnto the God of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and alſo that poperie is altogether abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in his ſight.</p>

If they make ſo much account of the taile, they would much more haue honoured the head, if they had come time enough to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket: what then would they haue done with the whole bodie, if they could haue gotten it? and if they make ſuch reckoning of a peece of a dead aſſe, I ſuppoſe that if they had the liuing aſſe, and could keepe him aliue (and yet what a foole am I to make a queſtion of their power in ſuch a thing, when as euerie man knoweth that their Pope and euery Prieſt of his begetting, can make God himſelfe, and we heard alſo before that the Pope himſelfe can make ſomething of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?) I ſuppoſe, I ſaie, that if they had the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aſſe (now I make no doubt of their keeping him aliue, yet for all that why doe they not make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him aliue againe?) they would gather a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile for determining what new honour ſhould be done vnto him.</p>
               <p>2 The like may be ſaid of their admonitions, citations, and excommunications, againſt them that haue beene dead and buried a long time: as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14153:57"/> againſt Bucer, Paulus Phagius, Tooly, Iohn Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and many other, whome beeing dead, they haue condemned, digged vp againe out of the earth, at leaſt their bones, or the bones of ſome other for theirs, and burned them. Is it not a toie for men to excommunicate them out of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, that God hath called out of the world? And are not theſe two ſpeciall endes of excommunication, one to keepe the Church from infection by the companie of ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue excommunication; the other to draw the perſons excommunicated to repentance? when death hath firſt taken them awaie, what feare is there of the firſt? what hope or poſſibilitie of the ſecond?</p>
               <p>3 As they doe thus abuſe excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo much more fooliſhly doe they abuſe and blaſphemouſly profane the holy ſacrament of baptiſme, in applying the ſame to churches, bels, and ſuch like. Chriſt biddeth nations to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, not churches or bells: Chriſt biddeth his diſciples teach and baptize; therefore alſo they may as well teach the goſpell to churches and bells, as baptize them. Neither haue churches and bells any ſinnes to be forgiuen, or whereof they can repent: therefore churches and bells neede not the ſacrament of theſe things, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially no other part of God his righteouſnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing vnto them, the which they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>performe. The ſame may be ſaid of ringing the bell in any great tempeſt, as though that could make faire weather. As fooliſhly alſo did they, and do they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14153:58"/> make boyes and little children Biſhops and Cardinals. Many and infinite other the like fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies there are in poperie, worthie to be laughed at by little children, more worthie to be derided by Eliiah and the Prophets of God: and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnworthie of the wiſdome of the moſt wiſe God. Certenly <hi>I</hi> meruaile why plaies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terludes, and comedies, were in ſuch requeſt in the time of poperie, ſith in their golden legend they might daily read or heare, and in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of their religion they did daily ſee ſuch pleaſant things, as would make better ſport then all the plaies in the world.</p>
               <p>4 Well, to conclude this argument ſeriouſly, drawne from their follies. When Dauid coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaited himſelfe a foole, and behaued himſelfe as a foole, by letting his ſpittle fall vpon his beard, and ſcrabbling vpon the walls before A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſh King of Gath, 1. Sam. 21. 13. how doth this King (in whome as there was no feare of God, ſo there could be no good wiſdome) like thereof? the ſcripture anſwereth that he did ſharply rebuke his ſeruants for bringing ſuch a perſon in his court, and that he ſaide vnto them: <hi>Loe, ye ſee this man is beſide himſelfe: wherefore haue ye brought him to me? haue I neede of madde men, that ye haue brought this fellow to plaie the madde man in my preſence? ſhall he come to mine houſe?</hi> In like ſort, yea and much more will the God of all wiſdome, rebuke thoſe that ſhall plead for poperie, or preſent Papiſts vnto his court. He ſhall ſaie to any that ſhall commend
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14153:58"/> Papiſts vnto his Maieſtie in this ſort: Loe, ye ſee theſe men are beſide themſelues, wherefore doe ye bring them to me? haue <hi>I</hi> neede of madde or fooliſh men, that ye haue brought them to play the madde men or fooles in my preſence? ſhall they come into my houſe? Thus will the Lord rebuke and checke ſuch as ſhall ſpeake for the juſtifying of Papiſts vnto him. Great men of this world take much and too much delight in fooles, and laugh at their follies (though they ſhould make better vſe of them:) but the onely wiſe God is delighted onely with true wiſdome, and ſuch as are truly wiſe. Therefore all the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Papiſts, and the fooliſh Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſo long as they continue ſuch, are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination vnto him. As for our religion, as it is no other then the Scripture commendeth, ſo it hath nothing but that which well beſeemeth the wiſdome of God, and therefore it cannot but be acceptable vnto him.</p>

               <p>2 Yea, but how is it prooued, that poperie is agreeable vnto and wel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pleaſing the naturall man? ſurely becauſe it requireth nothing but that which the naturall man may wel performe, and doth performe without any ſpeciall grace of God, and without any nevv worke of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as both beene ſufficiently ſhewed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14153:59"/> in larger treatiſes ſpecially ſpent in that theame. And who ſeeth it not to be ſo? For doth not poperie teach (as we haue heard before) that <hi>ignorance is the mother of deuotion?</hi> and doth it not from hence follow that men neither neede, nor ought to take paines in the ſtudie of the word of God? doth not the naturall man well like of this? Doth not poperie bidde men onely to beleeue as the Church beleeueth? can any thing be more eaſie? and doth not eaſe pleaſe the naturall man? doth not poperie extoll and magnifie the meere naturall diſpoſition of man, both denying it to be ſo throughly corrupt as we teach, and commending it to be willing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceiue, and to practiſe much good of it ſelfe? Is not this a pleaſant ſong for the eares of a naturall man? and is not his heart tickled with ſuch commendation? Againe poperie offereth forgiuenes of ſinnes, releaſe from hell, the whole kingdome of heauen, &amp;c. to ſale for money. What naturall man will higgle to giue any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for purchaſe of ſuch things? What ſhal I ſay more? Poperie biddeth men not to take to much paines about their hearts, neither to be at all carefull for reſiſting the firſt thoughts and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnto euill, for that theſe by popiſh doctrine are no ſinnes: it teacheth that God looketh not ſo much to the inward man, but regardeth the worke wrought, howſoeuer it be done, and that he in iuſtice cannot deny a good reward to ſuch merits. Can the naturall man diſlike of all this? Further, what naturall man is not readie, &amp; apt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14153:60"/> to worſhip images, to inuocate Saints, to ſweare, to profane the Lord his daie, or at leaſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue any holiday appointed onely by man more exactly, to be proud, to reſiſt magiſtrates, &amp;c. what naturall man, <hi>I</hi> ſaie, is not willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to theſe and the like?</p>
               <p>3 Yea but it is obiected, that our religion tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth faith onely to iuſtifie without works, and that therefore our religion is a doctrine of eaſe and libertie, and ſo conſequently more pleaſing the naturall man then poperie, which requireth many numbers of praiers, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to God onely, but alſo to Saints, many great iournies in pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, many offerings to the church, many almes, many good works, many merits, &amp;c. <hi>I</hi> anſwer, firſt acknowledging that we teach indeede that faith onely iuſtifieth euen without any workes whatſoeuer: yet is this faith more hard to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man then all before mentioned, to be taught and required by poperie. For this ſaith that we teach, muſt haue knowledge of God, &amp; of him whome he hath ſent, as alſo of the holy Ghoſt, and that as they are reuealed in the word, and likewiſe of the promiſes of God in his word particularly taught: it muſt alſo applie theſe things particularly to euery man his particular ſelfe. Secondly, though we ſay that good works are not neceſſarie as cauſes of iuſtification, yet we doe vtge true good workes (not ſuch as the Papiſts commend) more ſtraitly then they doe, &amp; teach them to be more neceſſarie, as effects &amp; fruits of iuſtification, and ſuch as without which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14153:60"/> there is no ſaluation. For we ſay that he that hath not eternall life begunne in him heare, that is, in whome the olde man is not crucified, and ſinne mortified, in whome the new man is not reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the life of godlines wrought, that man ſhal neuer haue eternal life in the world to come, neither ſhal euer enter into the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

Cor. 15. 50.</p>
               <p>4 As for all other things required by pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the naturall man can well brooke and beare ſo long as the inward may be diſpenſed withal; yea what is there ſo coſtly, though it come to the plucking off the earings, and giuing the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie iewells and ornaments that men vſe to weare, though it be the offering thouſands of bullocks and rammes, or ten thouſand riuers of oyle, what is ſo pretious though it be the firſt fruits of a man his owne bodie? what is ſo labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious &amp; painful, though it be the cutting of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with knives &amp; lancres as the prieſts of Baal did, or the whipping of himſelf til the blood fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or the pining of himſelfe by long faſting, or at leaſt by liuing onely of bread &amp; water, and by lying in woollen &amp; vpon bare boards, or taking no reſt many years togither, but onely ſtanding as many old Monks mentioned by <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> were wont to doe, &amp; ſome fooliſh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts yet doe: what, <hi>I</hi> ſaie of all theſe is ſuch, that a natural man wil not willingly vndergo, ſo it be repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Gods word &amp; deuiſed only by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14153:61"/> Againe, what though poperie require all theſe things? what alſo though nothing thereof be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed whilſt a man liueth here? ſhall he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to hell? No, ſaie the Papiſts, there is reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for that. When he dieth, and needeth no more to vſe his goods himſelfe, let him but giue liberally to the poore, eſpecially to the Church, and to prieſts for ſinging and ſaying of maſſes, dirges, trentalls, and other ſuch pleaſant ſongs for his ſoule, and then all ſhall be well enough. He ſhall not go to hell, but onely to purgatorie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kitchin, and there either to be a rafter, or a little to turne the ſpit, and then after a few yeares he ſhall be remooued from thence, and preferred euen to God his owne parlour in heauen. In the meane time who ſeeth not that the hope of this maketh any man, eſpecially of wealth and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, to giue liberally, if all the daies of his life he may liue in all licentious manner?</p>
               <p>5 But as for our religion it is farre otherwiſe therewith. For by abaſing the whole man and all that is in him, and teaching thoſe things which before haue bin ſpoken of, and ſhall not neede now to be repeated, it is altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant and vnſauorie to the naturall man, euen as ſmoke vnto the eyes, and vineger to the teeth: yet to God, yea therefore to God it is ſweete &amp; pleaſant. Certenly in this reſpect there is ſuch difference betwixt our religion and poperie, that if both were offered vnto the naturall man, he would make much ſooner choiſe of poperie then of ours. And this indeede is the cauſe why
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14153:61"/> of long tim,e and of moſt parts in the world, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie hath beene ſo generally receiued; &amp; why there haue beene more Papiſts then Proteſtants, namely becauſe our religion is altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to nature, and poperie altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable thereunto. Further let euery man exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his owne heart, how it ſtandeth naturally affected, and he ſhall finde himſelfe rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to poperie, wherein he may for a money matter, haue both pardon of any ſinne alreadie committed, and alſo a diſpenſation to commit what he will, though it be inceſt with his owne ſiſter, then to our religion which condemneth all ſuch pardons and diſpenſations. Sith therfore this is now ſo euident, that poperie is ſo ſutable to our corrupt nature, and that our religion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo harſh thereunto, why may I not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine conclude as before I haue done, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt poperie and alſo in behalfe of our religion?</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y laſt argument touching the maine concluſion, both againſt poperie and alſo for our religion, ſhall be from the teſtimonies of God himſelfe in this matter. By the teſtimonies of God, I meane not here the teſtimonies of his written word, but
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14153:62"/> reall and actuall teſtimonies (if I may ſo ſpeak) that is, ſuch things as whereby indeede God himſelfe hath iuſtified our, and condemned the Romiſh religion vnto the eyes of men, as by his written word he hath done the ſame vnto their eares. Neither let any man be offended, that I call ſuch things by the name of God his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, for ſo the like arguments are called in the ſcripture it ſelfe. Ioh. 5. 36. our Sauiour Chriſt calleth the workes that he did, the witneſſes or teſtimonies of his Father in his behalfe: <hi>I haue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>greater witnes then the witnes of Iohn: for the works which the Father hath giuen me to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, the ſame works that I doe, beare witnes of me that the Father hath ſent me.</hi> In like manner ſpeaketh the Apoſtle, Hebr. 2. 4. where he ſaith that God did beare witnes vnto his goſpel, both with ſignes and wonders, and diuerſe miracles, &amp; gifts of the Highoſt, according to his own wil.</p>
                  <p>2 Theſe actuall teſtimonies of God, wherof I purpoſe now to ſpeak, are eſpecially two. The firſt are the gifts of the ſpirit, which God hath promiſed to theſe laſt times of the world, for the commendation of the goſpell: the ſecond, are his other works, whereby likewiſe he doth beare witnes thereunto. Touching the firſt, let vs firſt of all conſider of God his promiſe for thoſe gifts; ſecondly of the performance of that promiſe. The promiſes are either made in the olde teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Prophets, or in the new by Chriſt himſelfe. The promiſes of the old teſtament are many. Firſt of all, the Prophet Dauid pſal. 68. 18.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14153:62"/> inſinuateth a promiſe of the gifts of the ſpirit in theſe words: <hi>Thou art</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>gone vp on high, thou haſt led captiuitie captiue, and receiued gifts for men:</hi> where the Prophet, by <hi>receiuing gifts for men,</hi> meaneth the gifts wherewith Chriſt as the Mediatour was furniſhed without meaſure, to beſtow vpon the Church after that he ſhould vanquiſh his enemies, &amp; triumphing ouer them ſhould aſcende into heauen, there to ſit at the right hand of God in all glorie and authoritie. This interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is manifeſt, both by the words immediately following, <hi>Praiſed be the Lord, the God of our ſaluation, which loadeth vs daily with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits;</hi> and alſo by the application thereof, Eph. 4. 8. where although the Apoſtle doe name one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the callings of the Church, yet doth it not therefore follow that the place in the pſalme is of ſuch gifts onely to be vnderſtoode, becauſe that euery generall may be applied not onely to ſome, but alſo to all particulars comprehended in the generall. The ſecond promiſe is, Iſa. 44. 3. where the Lord ſpeaking of the latter times of the church, ſaith thus, <hi>I will poure water vpon the thirſtie, and floods vpon the drie ground: I will poure my ſpirit vpon thy ſeede, and my bleſſing vpon thy budds, &amp;c.</hi> And leaſt any ſhould thinke, that this promiſe was onely made to the Iewes or Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites according to the fleſh, he addeth in the 5. v. <hi>One ſhal ſay I am the Lords, another ſhalbe called by the name of Iacob: and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand vnto the Lord, and name himſelfe by the came of Iſrael:</hi> which words doe teſtifie, that the

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as to the Iewes, becauſe the Iewes were alreadie of the houſe of Iſrael &amp; called by his name. The promiſe of the ſame gifts of the ſpirit is likewiſe ſignified, by leading or driuing of them to the ſprings of waters, Eſa. 49. 10. He renueth alſo the ſame promiſe, Ioel 2. 28. <hi>Afterward</hi> (ſaith the Lord in that place) <hi>will I poure out my ſpirit vpon all fleſh, and your ſonnes and your daughters ſhall propheſie: your olde men ſhall dreame dreames, and your young men ſhall ſee viſions: and alſo vpon the ſeruants and vpon the maidens in thoſe daies will I poure my ſpirit:</hi> ſo the ſame Prophet chap. 3. 18. expreſſeth the ſame promiſe in other words ſaying, <hi>In that date ſhal the mountaines drop downe new wine, and the hills ſhall flow with milke, and al the riuers of Iuda ſhall runne vvith vvaters, and a fountaine ſhall come forth of the houſe of the Lord, and ſhall water the valley of Shithim.</hi> By all theſe words he meaneth nothing elſe but the plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gifts of God his ſpirit, calling them by the name of wine, milke, and waters, both becauſe of the varietie of them, and alſo becauſe of their diuers effects, according to the diuers neceſſities of the diuers members of the Church. And leaſt this promiſe alſo ſhould be reſtrained onely to the Iewes, he addeth in the 21. v. this effect of the ſpirit, that <hi>he would clenſe their bloode whome he had not yet clenſed,</hi> meaning by <hi>thoſe whome he had not clenſed,</hi> the Gentiles, that till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt were <hi>without Chriſt, aliens from the common-wealth of Iſrael, ſtraungers from the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14153:63"/> couenant of promiſe, hauing no hope, and being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world,</hi> Eph. 2. 12. Finally the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Zacharie, chap. 14. &amp;c. hath this promiſe, <hi>In that daie ſhall the waters of life goe out of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, halfe of them toward the Eaſt, and halfe of them tovvards the vtmost ſea, and ſhall be both in ſommer and winter.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like are the promiſes in the old teſtament, which to belong to the new teſtament, and to be made for the credit and commendation of the goſpel, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the application of the promiſe in <hi>Joel</hi> made by Saint Peter. Act. 2. 16. And although that Prophet ſpeake of ſeeing viſions, dreaming dreames, and propheſying, &amp;c. yet by theſe are not onely to be vnderſtoode the ſame, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe ſerued then the good of the church, therefore by them the Prophet meaneth all ſuch gifts as ſhould make for the good of the church, vnder the goſpel the which is manifeſt, becauſe Saint Peter applieth this prophecie to the gift of tongues, beſtowed vpon the church at the feaſt of Pentecoſt.</p>
                  <p>3 Touching the New Teſtament firſt our Sauiour alluding vnto, and indeede plainly mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe promiſes of the olde Teſtament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, ſaith thus, Ioh. 7. 38. <hi>He that beleeueth in me (as ſaith the Scripture) out of his bell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e ſhall flow riuers of water of life.</hi> Where the Euangeliſt himſelfe interpreteth our Sauiour to ſpeake of the ſpirit, which they that beleeue ſhould afterward receiue. The like promiſe is made ſo often as he ſpeaketh of the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14153:64"/> Ioh. 14. 26. and 15. 26. 16. 7. and elſwhere. So alſo after his reſurrection, Act. 1. 5. <hi>Iohn indeed baptized with water, but ye ſhalbe baptiſed with the holy Ghoſt within theſe few dates.</hi> All theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doe teach and aſſure the Church that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſhould not come forth in the latter daies poore and deſolate, but rich and accompanied with an honourable traine of all neceſſarie gifts and graces of God his ſpirit: and that the more the goſpel ſhould flouriſh, the more plentifull alſo ſhould theſe gifts and graces flowe in the Church. Thus much for the promiſes of the gifts of the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>4 Touching the performance thereof, it is certen that it was eſpecially accompliſhed in the time of the Apoſtles: and fit it was it ſhould be ſo, becauſe the goſpel was then firſt to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto the Gentiles, who before that had neuer heard any ſuch doctrine: and becauſe alſo, as the Lord did then giue extraordinarie callings of the Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſo it was alſo meere that they ſhould haue gifts ſutable to their callings. Notwithſtanding it is not to be doubted, but that the promiſe ſhould remaine, and doth yet remaine in force, euen vnto the ende of the world, as touching the generall ſubſtance thereof; and that therefore although thoſe times are now paſt, and thoſe reaſons now ceaſed, when and why the Lord gaue ſuch gifts of his ſpirit, in ſuch extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meaſure and manner, yet he will neuer leaue his goſpel without ſuch a traine of the graces of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14153:64"/> the graces of his ſpirit as ſhall be ſomewhat an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the flouriſhing thereof, and meete likewiſe to commend the ſame the better vnto the world.</p>
                  <p>5 Sith this is ſo, I demaund whether this promiſe were performed to the church of Rome, holding the ſame doctrine that now it hath held for the ſpace of ſeauen or eight hundred yeares, and enioying that outward glorie and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, the which alſo theſe yeares it hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed? Certenly to this my demaund, it cannot be affirmatiuely anſwered with any truth. For all men know (or may know) the contrarie: yea the Papiſts themſelues, if they be not paſt all ſhame and grace will acknowledge the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. For when the Pope beganne to ſet his foote vpon the ſtaires, and to aſcende towardes that dignitie whereunto he is now mounted, then began the holy Ghoſt alſo, as it were, to take the wings of an Eagle or doue, and to flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, and returne againe towardes the heauens, from whence before he came. Euer ſince that time alſo, as the Pope hath climed the ladder of his magnificences, ſo the ſpirit of God hath mounted more and more towards heauen, and hath gone further and further out of the ſight of men. The more that the Pope and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petie haue growne and flouriſhed, the more haue all the gifts and graces of God his ſpirit decaied and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ithered. At the laſt when the Pope was reuealed to be the man of ſinne, the ſonne of perdition, &amp;c. and the verie
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14153:65"/> Antichriſt, that is, when he was come to the toppe and perfection of his pride, then alſo did the holy Ghoſt in a manner take his leaue and bidde all the world almoſt farewell, at the leaſt touching his viſible preſence. When all Kings and Princes had receiued and drunken the cup of his fornications, whereby beeing intoxicated and depriued of all true knowledge of God and common ſenſe, they abiected themſelues vnto him and put their necks vnder his girdle, yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed themſelues in moſt ſlauiſh manner to hold his ſtiroop, and kiſſe his filthie feete: when alſo they had receiued his marke in their foreheads, that is, themſelues had embraced his damnable doctrines, and ſtooped vnto his abominable i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and commanded alſo their people to doe the like: when, I ſay, the Pope and poperie vvere thus aduanced, and had iuſtled both the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of God and alſo all authoritie of Princes out of the throne, and moſt proudly did ſit in it themſelues, as it were booted and ſpurred: when (I ſay againe) the Pope with all his abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did thus ſit in the chaire of eſtate, both of Princes and alſo of God himſelfe, then what true knowledge was there, I wil not ſay of God, but euen of arts, of tongues, and almoſt of any good humanitie?</p>
                  <p>6 For triall of theſe things, if any thinke I ſlaunder them, let the rolles and Chronicles of thoſe times be ſearched: let the bookes of thoſe ages be peruſed, let their matter, their phraſe and ſtyle be examined. Was not the knowledge
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14153:65"/> of the Greeke ſo rare, that it was a common prouerb, <hi>Graecum eſt, legi non poteſt: It is Greeke, it cannot be read?</hi> And could the Hebrew tongue be more plentifull? No verily, but much rarer. What alſo ſhall I ſay of the Latin tongue? was the knowledge of that in thoſe times any better? very little. Euery boie indeede learned their primmer, and to ſay his praiers, and to helpe the Prieſt to ſaie Maſſe in latin, yet could he not tell whether he praied to God or the deuill: whether he asked bread or a ſtone, fiſh or a ſcorpion, yea not one Prieſt of an hundreth did vnderſtand the Mattins, that he continually ſaid, or the maſſes that he daily ſung; Rome was wont to be the mother of this tongue, and the Vniuerſitie and houſe of the eloquent oratours, but hauing once entertained the deepe myſterie of tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of bread into the bodie of Chriſt, all the former eloquence of this place was alſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated into barbariſme. This tongue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede was the common tongue of their religion at Rome and elſwhere, yet when their religion was at the full, then alſo was the knowledge of this tongue in the wane, yea in the very laſt quarter halfe ſpent. For it would make any man of knowledge to laugh, to reade or heare the words, phraſe, &amp; ſtyle of thoſe books that were then written. In their praiers indeede, (in which is leaſt neede of eloquence) eſpecially in their praiers to the Saints, and chiefly to the virgine Marie, by two or three figures they affected a kinde of eloquence to pleaſe the eares of men,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14153:66"/> and to make the praiers goe the more roundly, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o men might take the more delight in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſinging of them: but in moſt of their other writings there is nothing but plaine dunſtable latin, yea nothing for the moſt part but barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme.</p>
                  <p>7 If any man yet deſire further proofe of this ignorance, wherewith I charge the chiefe times of Poperie, let them read what M. Lambert re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth touching the ſame in his perambulation of Kent, writing of the place called Cliffe; what (I ſaie) he reporteth in that place of that matter out of William Malmesburie, <hi>de rebus gestis pontificum Anglorum:</hi> namely, that Curbert the eleuenth Archbiſhop of Canterburie, in a great Synode of all or moſt of the Biſhops of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, aſſembled by himſelfe to the foreſaide Cliffe (then called Cloueſhoo,) did there decree that the Prieſts themſelues ſhould firſt learne, and then teach their pariſhioners the Lord his praier, and the articles of his beleefe in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh tongue. In the ſame place alſo he noteth, that king Alfred in his preface vpon the paſtoral of Gregorie which he tranſlated, ſaith that when he came firſt to his kingdome, he knew not one prieſt of the ſouth ſide of Humber that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his ſeruice in latin, or that could tranſlate an epiſtle into Engliſh. Further, he addeth that Alfric in his proeme to the grammer, ſaith that a little before the time of Dunſtan the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, there was neuer an Engliſh prieſt that could either indite or vnderſtande a latine epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14153:66"/> and laſtly that William Malmesburie himſelfe ſaith, that at the time of the Conqueſt almoſt all the Biſhops of England were vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>8 This is not to be vnderſtood of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the latin tongue onely, but alſo of the very matter it ſelfe, and that not onely of books of diumitie, but alſo of bookes of philoſophie and humanitie.

Many diſtinctions in theſe bookes ſeeme wittie, and haue ſhewe of ſome depth in thoſe things whereof they intreat, but if they be thoroughly with iudgement exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and (as it were) ſifted or rather bolted, they will be found but meere trifles, more curious and troubleſome, then ſound and profitable: ſo farre alſo from illuſtrating and making light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome the things whereto they are applied, that rather they obſcure and darken them. Sometime perhaps a man may hitte vpon, or by the waie meete with ſomething ſomewhat worthie the obſeruation, but it is ſo rare that more time will be loſt whilſt a man ſinde it out, then the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the thing will counteruaile when he mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with it.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:14153:68"/>
                  <p>10 As thoſe bookes before ſpoken of doe witnes the learning or rather ignorance of thoſe times when they were written, ſo many men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo now liuing can teſtifie as much of the later times of poperie, both touching all the learned tongues, and alſo touching diuinitie, and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie. Notwithſtanding I charge not all of thoſe times, and of that religion with ſuch ignorance, but onely the moſt: ſome there were more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but very few. The greateſt part of thoſe that were brought vp in learning, and which profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed learning, were as ignorant and vnlearned as I haue ſaide. And how could it be otherwiſe, ſo long as they taught that principle before ſpoken of, that <hi>ignorance is the mother of deuotion?</hi> And albeit they meant the ignorance of God and diuinitie, yet therupon followeth that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of other things is alſo vnneceſſarie. For all other knowledge is eſpecially to be referred to diuinitie, as to the chiefe and principall ende thereof. This beeing taken away, what neede in a manner is there of other knowledge? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede they deſired that men ſhould haue had no good learning at al (as it is among the Turks) that ſo they might neuer diſcerne the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their religion. For they knew and feared, that the true knowledge of tongues, and arts, and humanitie, would quickly haue detected all the wickedneſſes and abominations of their religion. Therefore alſo when they could no longer keepe vnder the knowledge of theſe tongues and arts, but did ſee men to growe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14153:68"/> and flouriſh therein in deſpight of them, they made a ſolemne and common law amongſt them, that the vulgar corrupt tranſlation in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of the Bible ſhould onely be authenticall, and that alſo no man ſhould in any wiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from thence to the Hebrewe or Greeke text. By this canon they prouided, that although men grew to skill and knowledge of thoſe ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, yet this skill and knowledge ſhould little helpe them to any further learning of the holy Scriptures, then before they might haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto by the latin tongue. Yea ſo alſo they cunningly endeauoured to ſtoppe the courſe of ſuch knowledge. For who could haue any great heart to thoſe ſtudies, whereby he ſhould haue no helpe in diuinitie, the Queene of all ſtudies? Againe, touching that learning that was in the chiefe time or poperie, for the moſt part it was greateſt in them that inclined to our religion, and that did not a little diſlike of many groſſe points of poperie, and of many foule corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt the other Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>11 Now to conclude this part of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touching the generall ignorance that was in the pride of poperie, how will it ſtande with the rich and ample promiſes of God, before mentioned, for the powring out of water vpon the ground, and his ſpirit vpon all fleſh? If po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie were the religion that came from God, would God haue ſo pilled it and poulled it of all the gifts and graces of his holy ſpirit ſo often promiſed? If it had beene the ſame religion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14153:69"/> which the Apoſtles taught after the aſcenſion of Chriſt, and the primitiue Church receiued from them, would not the Lord haue commended it with his ſpirit as he then did? If the Church of Rome were the onely daughter of God, and ſpouſe of Chriſt (as ſhe boaſteth her ſelfe) would the Lord haue left her ſo naked of all ornaments? chiefly and principally beſeeming her eſtate, and moſt anſwerable to her royall diſcent? will any earthly Prince ſende forth his onely daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or let his wife goe abroad, without ſuch princely ornaments as her princely eſtate requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and whereby ſhe may be knowne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced with the reuerence of a Prince? much leſſe therefore may we dreame, that the Lord God of heauen, the Prince of all princes, would ſo rawly ſend forth his onely daughter, or Chriſt Ieſus his onely ſonne and heyre ſuffer his onely ſpouſe (whome he loueth as himſelfe) ſo poore and naked, as the Church of Rome was in her higheſt proſperitie.</p>
                  <p>12 I graunt that the Pope and his Cardinals had their rich ornaments and coſtly apparell, of ſiluer, gold, pretious ſtones, &amp;c. that alſo the reſt of that generation euen to the very hedge prieſt, had a gaie coate to weare in their holy buſines, that likewiſe all their Churches had great riches: I graunt that in all theſe things the Pope and poperie did farre excell Saint Peter with all the reſt of the Apoſtles, and likewiſe all the churches of their time, but theſe are not the ſpirituall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments that the ſpirituall nature of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14153:69"/> of God and ſpouſe of Chriſt requireth. The Church of God is indeede deſcribed, pſal. 45. 9. &amp;c. as a Queene ſtanding at the right hand of her husband Chriſt Ieſus, in a veſture of gold of Ophir, and as hauing apparel of broidered gold, and likewiſe that ſhee hath rayment of needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke, but the Prophet deſcribeth here the Church onely after the manner of an earthly Queene, meaning notwithſtanding by theſe things all manner of ſpirituall and heauenly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and therefore euen in the ſame place, and the beginning of the 13. verſe, ſhee is ſaid to be <hi>all glorious within.</hi> It is therefore certen that the chiefe ornaments of the Church, are inward and ſpirituall: the which wanting, whatſoeuer outward ornaments and riches ſhee hath, yet ſhee may be called <hi>wretched, miſerable, poore, blinde, &amp; naked,</hi> as Chriſt Ieſus calleth the church of the Laodiceans. Rev. 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>13 Now then, foraſmuch as the Church of Rome wanted thoſe ſpirituall ornaments which the Lord hath promiſed, and doth alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe vpon his daughter, I conclude therefore that ſhee is not the daughter of God, neither the ſpouſe of Chriſt. If it be ſaid that the true church hath not alwaies the like gifts, I freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it; yet this is certen, that the more the Church flouriſheth, the richer ſhee is in the gifts of God his ſpirite. But contrariwiſe the more the Church of Rome flouriſhed, the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſhee was in the graces of God his ſpirit. And here by the flouriſhing of the Church, I meane
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14153:70"/> not onely an outwarde flouriſhing in earthly things: for ſo I graunt that as the graces of God are many times choaked in particular member<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now in this ſenſe, when the doctrine which the church of Rome accounteth onely ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the contrarie whereof ſhee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth hereſie; when, I ſaie, this Romiſh doctrine moſt flouriſhed with leaſt gaine ſaying of any thereunto, when alſo that authoritie which the church of Rome chalengeth to her ſelfe, as her right was in ſuch regard, that neither Princes nor people made any reſiſtance, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were thoſe gifts of the holy Ghoſt promiſed to the true Church, in the latter times moſt rare and ſcarſe; when it was ſommer with the church of Rome touching all her prerogatiues which ſhee cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth, then it was the dead of winter touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe graces of God his ſpirit; ſo that ſcarſe any leaues of them did hang vpon any tree. Thus we ſee that thoſe promiſes were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the church of Rome in that eſtate wherein now it ſtandeth, and whereof it vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</p>

And thus hath the Lord dealt in theſe latter times.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14153:72"/> preachers of our religion, for the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof vnto the world, and ſo encreaſed them afterwarde more and more in thoſe that embraced our religion: but after that by ſuch gifts he had ſufficiently renewed and recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the credite of his truth which we doe now hold, and likewiſe by beautifying our religion with the firſt fruits of theſe gifts, had ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſgraced poperie, then he communicated theſe gifts vnto other euen vnto the Papiſts themſelues.</p>
                  <p>4 And truly in verie great wiſdom hath God done ſo, that he might teach men to eſteeme of his truth, not for thoſe gifts onely but alſo for the truths ſake it ſelfe. So alſo he would haue the Papiſts themſelues, yea and all the world to ſee, that all the learning in the world is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vphold poperie, and that our religion is as well able to ſtand againſt, and to beat downe poperie into the pitte of hell, from whence it came, as well when poperie hath the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour on that our religion hath, as when it was naked and had almoſt none at all. Therefore to conclude this part alſo of this my laſt argument, touching the performance of thoſe promiſes of God to the Church, that were neuer in ſuch manner performed to the Church of Rome. As the more the darke cloudes of poperie couered the whole earth, and the more violently alſo the boiſterous winds therof did blow vpon the earth, making the very cedars of Lebano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both to be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and to breake, the more dead were all the gifts
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14153:73"/> of the ſpirit, as we ſee all things to be in the depth of winter: ſo like wiſe ſithence our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath come about towards the ſommer point, and by the ſtrength and power thereof hath ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and diſperſed theſe cloudes, and pacified thoſe boiſterous winds of popery in many king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, the more haue thoſe gifts of God his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit before promiſed, budded and flouriſhed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as we ſee after an hard winter, the more the ſunne commeth about toward <hi>Cancer,</hi> the more all trees and hearbs before ſeare and dead, doe reuiue and ſpring out. I conclude therefore, that as by the ſpringing and flouriſhing of hearbs and other plants, we know ſommer to be come; ſo alſo by theſe gifts of God his ſpirit which haue ſprung and flouriſhed, euen ſithence that our religion hath beene reuiued &amp; againe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: we know the ſame goſpell to be againe returned about, the which in former times God according to the righteouſneſſe of his promiſe, did beautifie and comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with the like graces.</p>

                     </gap> great?</p>
                  <p>7 To this argument I may further adde, that the Lord hath not onely commended our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by the encreaſe of all learning according to the encreaſe of our religion, but alſo by the repairing almoſt of all other knowledge in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things and matters of this life. For what trade and ſcience is there ſo meane and baſe, which is not much amended and brought to further perfection ſithence the late time of out religion, then it had before in the depth of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perit? yea who knoweth not that there is great varietie of knowledge ſithence the flouriſhing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14153:74"/> of our religion, which neuer almoſt was heard of before? Eſpecially moſt admirable is the gift of printing, which neuer was in the world till within theſe hundred and three ſcore yeares at the moſt, about which time it pleaſed God to broch new veſſells of his goſpell with our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. This gift of printing is not vnfitly by ſome compared to the extraordinarie gift of tongues in the Apoſtles time; becauſe the Lord did not onely prepare a waie for the goſpel thereby, but alſo hath made it as a mightie voyce of a crier in the wilderneſſe of poperie, to proclaime the grace of God in Chriſt Ieſus, and to further and inlarge our religion, by opening the hearts of many Princes and more people, many noble and more baſe, many rich and more poore, and many learned and more vnlearned perſons, for the entertainment of Chriſt Ieſus, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues to his kingdome and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Certenly by this new benefit of printing the Goſpel hath beene more ſounded out to the eares of all nations, then it could haue beene by the voice of many preachers. For by the means hereof wee that liue in England, haue eaſily heard the ſermons and readings of Calvin and Beza in Geneva, and of other in other places: and they likewiſe that liue in Geneva and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, haue eaſily heard the readings of Doctour VVhitakers in Cambridge, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of Doctour Reynolds in Oxenford. This printing alſo is not onely as a quicke poſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon a ſwift and ſpeedie horſe, but alſo as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14153:75"/> an angel of the Lord with ſixe wings, for the moſt ſpeedie conueying of the doctrine of the goſpel out of one countrie into an other. Who alſo knoweth not, that a man may haue more now for ſixe pence, then before printing, he could haue had written for fourtie ſhillings? who ſeeth not alſo that bookes printed, are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily both read and alſo preſerued, then the like onely written? Now although the deuill abuſe this gift of God alſo for the furthering of popery, (as what gifts be there that he quickly doth not abuſe?) yet ſith it was neuer heard of whilſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus much for the firſt ſort of God his actuall teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, namely for the gifts of his ſpirit which before he promiſed, and according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe hath beſtowed vpon his Church, not onely in the time of the Apoſtles, but alſo in theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times for the commendation of the goſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

For truely there haue beene fewe ſuch ſpeciall aduerſaries to vs and our religion, whome God hath not in ſome ſpeciall manner ſo puniſhed here in this life, or at leaſt ſo proſecuted that their malice in their poſteritie, that all the worlde might thereby clearely ſee, that he vtterly diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of them and of their courſe, as alſo approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and allowed of them &amp; their cauſe, againſt whome they oppoſed and ſet themſelues. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14153:76"/> theſe iudgements, although I might eaſe my ſelfe and the reader of much labour, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring him onely to the latter ende of the booke of Martyrs, where is a ſpeciall treatiſe of ſuch things; yet becauſe that booke is of ſo great price that many are not able to buie it, I will therefore cull out ſome few of the principall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples there and elſewhere in that booke mentioned, and for the reſt referre ſuch as haue that booke to that ſpeciall treatiſe. Firſt of all let here be remembered the hiſtorie of one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier or Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ie, in the daies of King Henrie the eight: this Pauier or Pauie beeing towne clarke of the citie of London, and a notable enemie to the goſpel, vpon ſome report that the goſpel ſhould be in Engliſh, ſaide with a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ath, that if he thought the King would in deede ſet forth the Scripture in Engliſh, and let it be read to the common people by his authoritie, he would cut his owne throat. And ſo indeede he did not much leſſe. For though he cut not his throat with a knife, yet he hanged himſelfe with an haltar, anno Dom. 1533. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Maſter Fox, page 1055. of his booke printed 1583. but borrowed from Hall his Chronicle, who wrote the ſame not vpon the report of other, but vpon his owne knowledge, who both heard him ſweare that he would cut his owne throat, and alſo knew how he brake promiſe by hanging himſelfe. In the ſame yeare alſo, that is 1533 one Doctour Foxford chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour to the Biſhop of London, and a cruell
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14153:76"/> perſecutor and butcher of God his Saints vnder Biſhop Stokeſly, died ſuddenly and fearefully <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> in his chaire, his bellie breaking and his guttes falling out before his owne eyes.</p>
                  <p>3 Next to theſe let be conſidered that of William Gardiner an Engliſh marchant, moſt cruelly martyred at Liſhbone in Portugal, for ſnarching the hoſt with one hand, and beating the chalice with the other out of both the hands of a Cardinoll, before the King and all his nobles, the Lords daie after a ſolemne marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the ſaide King his ſonne with the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the King of Spayne, anno Dom. 1552. and in the raigne of King Edward the ſixt of moſt bleſſed memorie. Let, I ſay, be here alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered the iudgement of God following the execution of that moſt holy martyr by the Portugalls at Liſhbone for the cauſe before mentioned. For how did they, by whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie he was ſo executed, eſcape? The ſame night he was burned, one of the ſparkes of the fire where with he was burned, by God his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence beeing conueied amongſt the King his ſhippes lying in the hauen, fired one of them and burned it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> within halfe a yeare after the young Prince then married, died: and the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo within another halfe yeare after that, and ſo within one yeare both the king and his ſonne died.</p>
                  <p>4 An other example we haue of one Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the keeper of Newgate, not much vnlike to Alexander the copperſmith, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtle
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14153:77"/> complaineth; this Alexander dealt moſt cruelly with thoſe that were committed to his cuſtodie in new gate for the goſpel. But what became of him he died moſt miſerably being both ſwolne more like a monſter then a man, &amp; ſo eaten alſo within, that no man could abide the ſmell of him. Yea further, the Lord his wrath was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo againſt his ſonne: for he being left very rich, was giuen ouer to ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iotous mind, that he waſted all within three yeares: and beeing ſometime asked how he could ſpend ſo much in ſo little time, he would anſwer, that <hi>euill gotten muſt be as euill ſpent.</hi> Shortly after alſo as he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in newgate market, he fell downe ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo died fearefully.</p>
                  <p>5 Another example there is alſo regiſtred of a Sheriffe of Suffolke his man, that attending vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his maſter at the martyrdome of one Iames Abbes at S. Edmonds Burie, and hearing the fald Iames Abbes exhort the people to ſtande in the goſpell which he would in their preſence ſeale with his blood, bad the people not beleeue him, becauſe he was a madde man &amp; ſpake he knew not what. But marke good reader: This rayling and rauing Papiſt, as ſoone as fire was put to Iames Abbes, was immediately before all the people ſtricken with madnes, ſo that he cried out as much in commendation of Iames Abbes, as before he railed on him: condemning alſo himſelfe, and ſaying, Iames Abbes is a good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God and ſaued, but I am damned. This note he ſung vntill his dying daie, railing alſo on
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14153:77"/> the prieſt that his maſter ſent for to houſle him a little before his ende; yea not onely railing on the prieſt, but alſo on papiſts and poperic, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to be the cauſe of his damnation. Another example we haue of God his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon Fiſher Biſhop of Rocheſter, and Syr Thomas More knight: theſe had beene perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Proteſtants, eſpecially they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the death of Iohn Frith, Bayfield, and Baynham. Therefore the Lord cried alſo quit with them, for themſelues alſo were publikely executed at Tower hill.</p>
                  <p>6 Worthie alſo of remembrance is that which M. Fox likewiſe writeth of one Vanderwarfe of Antwerp, who as he was of great place and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in that citie, ſo alſo was he of great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt the Proteſtants, moſt cruelly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting all, and drowning many men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to his great praiſe among other of that cruell generation. For this alſo he was called a blood-hound, or bloodie dogge. But God in whoſe eyes the death of all his Saints is alwaies right pretious, forgot not his crueltie: for this Vanderwarfe hauing gotten great riches, and therefore left Antwerp, liuing in the countrey at his caſe, at a certaine time came in a waggon with his wife, and ſome other to make merrie at Antwerp, where hauing recreated himſelfe, he returned againe towarde the countrie. As ſoone as he was out of the citie, beeing to goe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a wooden bridge, built (as ſhould ſeeme) but for a ſhift and for a time, hauing barres and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14153:78"/> rayles on both ſides, the horſe in the waggon ſtoode ſtill, and would not goe forwarde by any meanes of the waggoner. Vanderwarfe his bloode beeing vp, and prouoked againſt the waggoner, bad him driue forward in a thouſand deuills names. Immediately vpon this there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe ſuddenly a mightie whirle winde (all being calme before) which toſt the waggon with this gentleman &amp; other paſſengers ouer the bridge, and ſo they fell into the water. The reſt beeing ſaued, and take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp aliue for the preſent, (though his wife died within three daies after) himſelfe onely was drowned, as he had drowned many before. What alſo ſhall I ſay of the miſerable &amp; deſperate death of Steuen Gardiner the great blood-ſucker of this land? for at his death ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhop co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto him, &amp; (as it ſeemeth) finding him in a deſperate minde; put him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Peter his denying Chriſt. But he ſauouring no comfort therein, anſwered that he had denied Chriſt with Peter, but neuer repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Peter.</p>
                  <p>7 What alſo ſhal I ſaie of Henrie the ſecond of that name King of France? had he not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted certaine great perſons to priſon for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and threatned one of them to ſee him burnt with his owne eyes? yet behold the worke of God herein. Shortly after he had not eyes to ſee it: for the very ſame daie that the King was in the greateſt rage againſt the foreſaide priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and had examined the Preſidents &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers of the Parliament againſt them, after
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14153:78"/> dinner addreſſing himſelfe to runne at the tilt, and indeede performing that acte very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably with the breaking of many ſtaues, to his great commendation by all the beholders. He not ſatisfied with that which he had done, but tickled with the former commendation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of more according to the nature of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition (which thinketh no praiſe ſufficient) vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Countie of Mountgommer to runne an other courſe with him. This Countie had before receiued the former priſoners from the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of France vpon the Kings commandement, and carried them to priſon. Notwithſtanding now when the King vrged him to runne an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe; he kneeled downe and craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as thinking the king to haue done inough for one daie; but the King preuailing more by commanding, then the other could doe by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, at the laſt this Countie addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to this laſt courſe, which indeede was the laſt courſe of that daie and for cuer to the king: for the ſtaues beeing broken, and the King his vizzard ſuddenly falling off (ſo doth the Lord worke to bring his iudgements to paſle) one of the ſhiuers pearſed his head vnto the braines, and ſuddenly ſo feſtered that no ſurgeons could cure the ſame. Thus the King loſt one of thoſe eyes, where with he threatned to haue ſeene the burning of thoſe perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; died alſo of that hurt.</p>
                  <p>8 Neither may we here well omit the death of Charles the ninth of that name King of France, in whoſe time &amp; by whoſe meanes that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14153:79"/> bloodie maſſacre, before mentioned was done in Paris, and in many other cities of France. For as the King had delighted himſelfe in the blood of his Saints, ſo himſelfe alſo in his youth at the age of 25. yeares died of a moſt grieuous blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Many other the like examples are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by M. Fox, both of our owne countrie and alſo of other nations, of ſome that were ſtricken with madnes, of ſome that did hang or drowne themſelues, and of other that died in deſpaire moſt fearefully, and that in ſuch manner as that all the world might ſee the iuſt iudgement of God againſt them, both for their religion and alſo their malicious perſecuting of ſuch as were of our religion.</p>
                  <p>9 To theſe will I adde an other example not yet written by any, but yet as trew as any of the former, (whereof not with ſtanding ſome are knowne to all the world) and alſo no leſſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the writing then the former. At great Wenham in Suffolke, in the daies of King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the eight, there dwelt one M. Cardinal, whoſe wife hauing heard one M. Worthe a godly man &amp; good preacher, preach at Hadley about ſome three myles from thence, at her returne home entreated her husbande one daie to requeſt M. Worthe to come and preach with them. Maſter Cardinall though at the firſt fearing ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of law, yet at the laſt yeelded, and indeede proceeded and procured M. Worth to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The parſon of the ſaide Wenham beeing popiſh, withſtood M. VVorth beeing come, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14153:79"/> that no ſuch ſhould preach there; M. Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intreated but the parſon denied, beeing like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o the dogge in the manger that wil neither eate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aie himſelfe, nor ſuffer the horſe at the racke to eate any. So, I ſaie, this parſon (as ſome alſo doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n theſe daies) neither would nor could doe good himſelfe, neither would ſuffer any other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o doe any. At length M. Cardinall ſeeing the parſon ſo wilfull and obſtinate, ſaide that M. VVorth ſhould preach doe the parſon what he could to the contrarie, and come what daunger would come. In fine they went all to Church, and many other vpon knowledge of M. VVorth his preaching were aſſembled. Now when M. VVorth ſhould begin his ſermon, the parſon according to his froward word for the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of him, went toward the high altar to ſaie, maſle. VVhat followed? a moſt worthie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of God his iuſtice. For preſently before all the people aſſembled, the Lord ſmote this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh parſon for dead for the time, drawing his mouth vp to his eare, and ſo made him paſt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of maſſe. Notwithſtanding beeing carried out of the church for auoiding further trouble of the congregation, he was within little time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered of his life, yet neuer recouered his witts and ſenſes, but liuing long after, continued a foole all the daies of his life, and turned the ſpit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> was imploied vpon ſome other ſeruice in the ſaide M. Cardinall his houſe euer after. I haue heard this of many very credible perſons, who had often heard it from M. VVorth, long time
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14153:80"/> after (euen in this Queenes daies) viccar of Ded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham in Eſſex, and of many other that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at that ſermon, and were eye witneſſes of the iudgement. Some alſo are yet liuing about VVenham aforeſaid that knew it.</p>
                  <p>10 I might adde many other examples of God his iudgements againſt like perſons for like cauſe: but theſe ſhall be ſufficient. For by theſe who ſeeth not (that hath any eyes at all to ſee) in what account poperie is with the Lord? Let all men therefore by theſe examples take heede that they deceiue not themſelues. Let not them blindfold their owne eyes that they may not ſee the things thus manifeſt. Let them not diſgrace the reports of M. Fox, ſith many things written by him are alſo written by other before him, from whome he borrowed that which he did write. Some things of his are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and knowne to all men. I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that M. Fox in writing ſome things vpon the report of others might ſometime erre. And although his ſlippe in ſuch things be taken great hold of by the Papiſts, who there by take occaſion to diſgrace all the truth he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to couer their owne crueltie, to conceale God his iudgements, &amp; to harden themſelues in poperie, and the more eaſily to draw other to be of this minde; yet let the wiſe and true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian conſider, that it was by the deuills great policie, to mooue ſome (no doubt) in colour of ſynceritie, and pretending a minde of helping M. Fox in that worthie worke, to informe him
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14153:80"/> with ſome vntruths, that by his writing of them vpon ſuch information, all the reſt of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting might be in diſgrace, as being in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner vntrue. This no doubt, was the ſubtiltie of the old ſerpent, and of his viperous litter, ſo to diſgrace that noble worke, and ſo to obſcure thoſe euident examples of Gods diſalowance of their religion, as though he had written no truth, when the moſt of the things by him chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicled, are as cleare as the ſunne is in the midſt of the brighteſt ſommer day. But albeit ſome be giuen ouer in the iuſt iudgement of God, to beleeue truthes to be lies, becauſe they haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced lies for truthes; yet I hope that ſuch as belong vnto the Lord, though perhaps by ſuch deuiſes they haue beene abuſed, will now make better vſe of theſe examples that I haue ſet downe, and the like. Thus much for thoſe works of God againſt poperie and Papiſts, whereby he hath (as it were) immediately teſtified his diſlike of both.</p>

To begin with Luther, when it pleaſed God firſt to open his eyes to ſee both the abominations of poperie, and alſo the truth of the goſpell, and likewiſe to deliuer him from the miſerable darknes and bondage of the one, and to tranſlate him to the glorious light and libertie of the other, yea to giue him an heart, courage, and tongue, boldly (as the Lords herault) to condemne, and diſclaime the former, and to preach and proclaime the other; how many, how diuers, how great, and how mightie aduerſaries had he? How few alſo, how ſimple, and how weake were thoſe that tooke his part? yet how mightily and how miraculouſly did God preſerue &amp; vphold him, yea alſo bleſſe and proſper the worke of his miniſterie, almoſt to all Chriſtendome?

To omit forraine aſſaults, many home rebellions, many ſecret conſpiracies and priuie treaſons, many open inſurrections, haue beene againſt her Highnes from time to time. Many haue beene ſent partly from the Pope, partly from the King of Spayne, firſt adjured by their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the altar, ſecretly or openly moſt traiterouſly to murther her.

Who then bridled them? who tooke away all heart and courage from them? Is it not euident to all men, and muſt not all men acknowledge, that the ſecret power of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie did both withhold them, and alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue her? And may not ſhee truly ſaie with the Prophet, pſal. 94. 17. <hi>If the Lord had not holpen me, my ſoule had almoſt dwelt in ſilence?</hi> But is this all? No verily: the Lord hath not onely thus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly kept her, but alſo highly honoured her in the eyes of all nations. As ſhee maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the cauſe of Chriſt Ieſus, ſo God hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to her in ſome ſort, the promiſes made vnto Chriſt Ieſus. As ſhee is a principall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſpouſe of Chriſt Ieſus, ſo hath God honoured her with thoſe honours that he hath promiſed to the ſame ſpouſe. All Princes almoſt haue brought preſents vnto her, and all people haue beene in admiration of her. Search all hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, turne ouer all Chronicles, ſacred or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, diuine or humane, eccleſiaſticall or ciuill, yet ſhall ye neuer finde a woman prince, a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Queene, whoſe preſeruation hath beene ſo mightie, whoſe glorie ſo great, whoſe gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo long, ſo proſperous and ſo happie.</p>
                  <p>5 All this hath beene the more admirable, and is the more to be conſidered, by how much the more and oftner ſhee hath beene curſed with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14153:83"/> bell, booke, and candle, by him that arrogateth to himſelfe <hi>plenitudinem poteſtatis,</hi> all authoritie in heauen, in earth, and in hell it ſelfe. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no ſmall force vnto my argument againſt him and all his religion. For if he were he whom he vaunteth himſelfe to be: if he were Peter his ſucceſſour, and Chriſt his viccar-generall vpon earth: if he were the head of the Church, if he had the keies of heauen, if he could not erre; how could he haue erred in ſending forth ſo many curſes cauſeles? or if the cauſe of his curſes were iuſt (the which he rather pretendeth) how could he ſo often haue curſed without ſucceſſe? Chriſt hath ſaid and promiſed to Peter and his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour (as they teach) that whatſoeuer, or whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he ſhould binde or looſe in earth, the ſame ſhould be bound or looſed in heauen. Haue his curſes beene ſuch? verily they neuer came halfe waie to heauen, or els when they came there, Saint Peter was ſo faſt aſleepe that they could not awake him to let them in: or els when they were let in or crouded in, they were nipped in the head, and by the regents there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with a <hi>Neſcio,</hi> or <hi>Non placet.</hi> But I will not ſpeake too much of this, leaſt I prouoke his holines to commence an action againſt Chriſt himſelfe, for not keeping promiſe, yea to ſende out a bull and excommunication againſt him. For then what ſhould become of vs poore Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, if our head ſhould be thus hardly dealt withall?</p>
                  <p>6 Notwithſtanding I feare him not greatly,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14153:84"/> ſith I haue ſeene by ſo much experience, that his bulls are but bubbles; yea that the high court of heauen, hath alwaies turned his curſings into bleſſings. For I doubt not, but that the more he hath curſed her Maieſtie and this lande, the more God hath bleſſed both. Eliſha curſed the two captaines with their fifties, which were ſent to apprehend him and carrie him to the King, and preſently fire came downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and conſumed them. 2. King. 1. 11. Eliſha curſed thoſe vnhappie hangmans and wicked boyes that mocked him, and preſently came two Beares out of the forreſt which deuoured them. 2. King. 2. 29. The ſame Prophet likewiſe curſed his ſeruant Gehazi, for that ſinne which before we haue heard to be the life of the Pope, and preſently the leproſie of Naaman did faſten on him and cleaue vnto him. 2. King. 5. 27. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid curſed Ioab, praying the Lord to remember him according to his wickednes, 2. Sam. 3. 39. &amp; ſo it fell out to Ioab, 1. King. 2. 34. Paul curſed Elimas the ſorcerer with blindnes, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately there fell on him a myſt &amp; darknes, ſo that he went about ſeeking ſome to lead him by the hand, Act. 13. 11. If therefore this <hi>bonus ſenex</hi> and <hi>holy father,</hi> had curſed with the ſame ſpirit wherewith they curſed, and in the ſame name in whoſe alſo they curſed, his curſes alſo would haue had the ſame effect. But ſithence they had the cleane contrarie, may we not ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he is not the Vickar of Chriſt, but rather the deputie of the deuill; and that the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14153:84"/> vickar of Saint fooles is his ghoſtly father? yea that he is the aduerſarie of Chriſt and childe of perdition, in taking vpon him to curſe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed of the Lord, who is alſo the bleſſed of the Lord. Certenly foraſmuch as his curſes are no more effectuall, but alwaies turned into ſuch bleſſings, I wiſh he would likewiſe curſe me; for then I thinke I ſhould both liue the longer, notwithſtanding my preſent infirmities of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which daily threaten death vnto me, and alſo euerie other way be the more bleſſed. Dauid hoped of ſome good from the Lord, for curſing of Shimei after another manner, 2. Sam. 16. 12. ſo if the Pope would alſo curſe me, I ſhould hope to fare likewiſe the better thereby.</p>
                  <p>7 To end this argument therfore drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch examples: if Nabuchadnezzer ſeeing the mightie deliuerance of Shadrack, Meſhach, and Abednego, in the fierie ouen, did acknowledge their God to be the only God, Dan. 3. 29. If Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius ſeeing the ſtraunge preſeruation of Daniel from the mouth of the Lyons, when he was caſt into their denne to haue bin deuoured of them, did likewiſe confeſſe the God of Daniel to be the liuing God which remaineth for euer, Dan. 6. 26. ſhall any that profeſſe themſelues, and would be accounted Chriſtians, ſee ſo many and ſo great mercies of God towardes other profeſſing our religion, and ſo miraculouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed: ſhal any, I ſay, that would be accounted Chriſtians, ſeeing all theſe things done by God himſelfe, for the vpholding and maintaining of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14153:85"/> our religion and the profeſſours thereof, yet make doubt of our God whither he be the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, and of our religion whither it be the true religion?</p>
                  <p>8 Yea but me thinketh, I heare one obiect the great plentie that was in the time of poperie, when one might buie 24. egges for a pennie, a good cowe for a noble, or eight ſhillings, an oxe for a marke, a ſheepe for twentie pence, a buſhell of wheat for foure or ſixe pence. And that ſithence this new religion (for which I now plead) came vp, there was neuer ſuch plentie, neither was it euer ſo merrie with vs. This is an old obiection, and worne in a manner with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten handling cleane through: yea it is ſo olde that it is euen rotten and conſumed, ſo that if it be but touched, it will fall to duſt or pouder. It was vſed by the Iewes to Ieremie againſt the word of God that he preached, and for defence of their former idolatrie: <hi>When,</hi> ſay they, <hi>we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Queene of heauen</hi> (or as ſome doe read more generally, the things of heauen) <hi>then we had plentie of victualls, and were well, and felt no euill; but ſithence we left ſuch idolatrie, we haue beene conſumed by the ſword, and by famine.</hi> Ier. 44. 17, 18. To this obiection I returne a threefold an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer briefly. Firſt I ſaie that this plenty of things in former time of poperie, is not eaſily prooued as ſpoken. For although a man might then buie ſo much for ſo little as hath beene ſpoken of, yet this prooueth not ſuch plentie, except there had beene as great plentie alſo of money, to haue
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14153:85"/> bought the other things ſo cheape. Then a penie was as hard to come by, as a teſter is now: for then a labouring man had but a penie a daie for his worke, but now he hath ſixe pence or a groat at the leaſt. Therefore it skilleth not though things be now dearer then they were then, as long as money is more plentifull and eaſie to be come by. So likewiſe it may be ſaide as well of the commodities which the poore man hath to ſell, as which the rich man hath. When therefore a man may haue a groat nowe or ſixe pence as eaſily as then he could haue a penie, may he not as well giue a groat or ſixe pence for that which he buieth now, as then he did giue a penie? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the number of people beeing now ſo encreaſed aboue that it was then, as we ſee it to be, and compared with the ſmall number of thoſe times, doth prooue that there was no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plentie in thoſe times then is now. Yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth not this commend the mercie and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie of God the more, in prouiding as well for the great multitude that is nowe, by the meanes of the long and great peace we haue had, as he did then for that ſmall number of people that was then? If it be obiected, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny townes &amp; cities were greater then, then now they be, and that this prooueth as great a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to haue bin then, as is now: I anſwer that as ſome townes and cities are decaied, ſo alſo many more both townes, cities, and villages, are mightily encreaſed. Thirdly, though the former plentie of former times ſhould be graunted, yet

Here I will not referre the reader to the hiſtories and bookes of other, but doe onely intreat him wiſely and in the feare of God to conſider ſuch things as haue beene ſo lately done in the eyes of the whole worlde, as that euery childe of twelue yeares age knoweth them and talketh of them.</p>
                  <p>2 Firſt therefore let the great Navie of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14153:88"/> king of Spayne, ſent forth anno Dom. 1588. for the inuaſion of this kingdome, and captiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the people (if it had beene poſſible) be conſidered, with the ſucceſſe which it had. This Navie was ſo great, as that the ſeas neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did beare the like, and therefore alſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues did call it the inuincible Navie. Neither was it ſent forth onely by the King of Spayne himſelfe, but alſo with all the bleſſings that might be of the Pope and the whole Church of Rome. As the whole popiſh holy cleargie in England in Queene Maries daies, made many earneſt and loude praiers, went many ſolemne proceſſions, and ſang many deuote Maſſes for the childe-birth and ſafe deliuerance of Queene Marie; ſo in like manner did the Pope and colledge of Cardinalls, and the whole ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Synagogue of Rome, in Rome, in Spayne, and in many other places, make the like ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, goe the like proceſſions and ſing the like maſſes, for the good and happie ſucceſſe of the ſaide Navie. Therefore came this great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, not onely intending all violence and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, but alſo fully perſwaded (in their owne hearts) of all victorie. They made the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of preuailing againſt Englande, that ſometime Senacherib King of Aſhur with his Captaine Rabſhakeh made of preuailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ieruſalem, and therefore ſaide (no doubt) in their hearts ſecretly, the ſame that Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhakeh ſpake in words openly, 2. King. 18. 25. <hi>Am I now come vp without the Lord to this place
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14153:89"/> to deſtroy it? The Lord hath ſaide vnto me, goe vp againſt this land and deſtroie it.</hi> They thought it had beene impoſſible for vs to haue eſcaped their hands, as ſometimes Benhadad king of Aram did thinke it impoſſible for the Iſraelites to eſcape out of his hands, and therefore hearing that men were come out of Samaria againſt him, he made not reckoning of it, but ſaid, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be come out for peace, take them aliue, or whether they be come ought to fight, take them yet aliue.</hi> 1. King. 20. 18. Finally they ſo preſumed vpon the vertue of the Popes bleſſing and vpon their great forces, that they made reckoning before of deuiding the ſpoile amongſt them, as ſometime Siſera and his mother with her wiſe ladies did, of deuiding the ſpoile of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites. Iudg. 5. 29.</p>
                  <p>3 But what came of all this? Truly, as there neuer had beene ſent forth the like power by ſea againſt any people, ſo was there neuer the like ouerthrow. They had not cried loud ynough vnto their gods, therefore they did not helpe them: they ſet themſelues againſt the God of heauen, therefore he confounded them. They ſaid as the Egyptians ſaide, Exod. 15. 9. <hi>We will purſue, we will ouertake them, we will deuide the ſpoyle, our luſt ſhall be ſatisfied vpon them, we will draw our ſword, our hand ſhall deſtroy them:</hi> but we may truly ſing and ſay as Moſes and the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites in that place ſung and ſaid, verſ. 6, 7, 10. <hi>Thy right hand, O Lord, is glorious in power, thy right hand, O Lord, hath bruiſed the enemie. And
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14153:89"/> in thy great glorie haſt thou ouer throwne them that roſe againſt thee: thou ſenteſt forth thy wrath which conſumed them as the ſtubble. Thou bleweſt with thy winde, the ſea couered them, they ſanke as lead in the mightie waters.</hi> All this may we truly ſay, becauſe the Lord, the Lord onely did ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Pharao and his people in the redde ſea. He gaue their fleſh to be meate to the fiſhes, as before he had giuen the fleſh of the Egyptians. Yea he did this in a maner without any ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of men, he commanded both winde and ſea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and they both obeyed, that ſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe might haue all the glorie, and none might giue any part thereof to vs, neither we take any part thereof vnto our ſelues: yea that ſo he might make it knowne to all the world, that Pope and Spanyard had not onely oppoſed themſelues vnto the Queene of England and her religion, but alſo to the God of heauen and his truth. So that as all the praiers, proceſſions, and maſſes here in England for Queene Marie her ſafe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, &amp; for the yong Prince in her wombe, came to nothing: in like maner did all the works of like deuotion, by the Pope himſelfe and the reſt of the Church of Rome, in Rome and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, come to leſſe then nothing. For as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his curſes of our Queene and land were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into bleſſings: ſo now alſo his bleſſings of the Spanyard and his forces, were turned into curſes. Who ſeeth not by this, that he that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the heauens did laugh them to ſcorne, and that that the Lord had them in deriſion? as
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14153:90"/> it is ſaid and threatned vnto all ſuch as aſſemble togither againſt the Lord and againſt his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed. pſal. 2. 2. &amp;c. As the prophets &amp; prieſts of Baal cried vnto their gods, ſo did the Spanyard vnto his gods, both which he imagineth to be in heauen, and alſo before which he falleth downe and worſhippeth in the earth, I meane both vnto all his Saints, and alſo to all his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen images made of woode, ſtone, ſiluer, and gold, &amp;c. As Eliſha cried vnto the true God, ſo alſo did we in the daie of our trouble. We faſted and praied lifting vp our hearts and our handes vnto God in the heauens, commending our ſelues and all our forces onely to him. Therefore as the prieſts of Baal laboured in vaine: ſo alſo did the Spanyard. As Elija, Iehoſaphat, Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaie, and Eſter, and many other the good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, were heard in that they praied; ſo alſo were we. Wherefore, as Elija by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confounded the prieſts of Baal, proouing their god to be no god, their worſhip to be falſe worſhip, and contrarily did approoue himſelfe to worſhip the true God, in true manner: ſo alſo why may not we by the like argument, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the god of the Pope and the Spanyards to be no god, and their religion likewiſe to be no religion: and on the contrarie conclude and boldly affirme our God only to be the true God, and our religion to be that religion which this our true God hath once commanded, doth dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commaund, and euer accepteth? Truly ſo great was our daunger in that expedition of the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14153:90"/> Spanyard againſt vs, that ſithence our deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from the ſame we may truly ſay as the Church ſaith, pſal. 124. <hi>If the Lord had not bin on our ſide,</hi> may England now ſay, <hi>if the Lord had not bin on our ſide, they had then ſwallowed vs vp quicke, when their wrath was kindled againſt vs: then the waters had drowned vs, the ſtreame had gone ouer our ſoule, then had the ſwelling waters gone ouer our ſoule. Praiſed be the Lord, which hath not giuen vs as a praie vnto their teeth. Our ſoule is eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, euen as a bird out of the ſnare of the fowler: the ſnare is broken, and we are deliuered. Our helpe is in the name of the Lord, which hath made heauen and earth.</hi> This whole pſalme in reſpect of our migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie deliuerance, may we as truly applie vnto our ſelues, as before we ſhewed that we might applie part of the ſong of Moſes and the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, when they were newly deliuered from their ſlauerie and bondage out of the lande of Egypt.</p>
                  <p>4. The ſecond example of theſe mixt workes of God againſt Pope and poperie, and alſo for vs and our religion, is the honourable and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſucceſſe of our forces laſt yeare ſent forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spanyards vnder the conduct of the right honourable and moſt worthie Earle of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, and the Lord Admiral: eſpecially if it be compared with the former ſucceſſe of the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard againſt vs. For the Spanyard comming againſt vs (as before is ſaid) with ſuch huge and mightie forces as he thought inexpugnable, and finding vs as it were in a manner altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14153:91"/> vnprepared to meete him ſo ſuddenly, and indeede of our ſelues not able then to haue reſiſted him, yet could not ſo much as ſet any footing of any one man within any part of our land; but by the mightie hand of God ſtretched out from heauen againſt him, was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne in vain, yea with loſſe (at the leaſt) of halfe his forces both ſhippes and men by the waie, to the euerlaſting ſhame and diſhonour of him and of his religion. But on the contrarie our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beeing nothing ſo great as his were, neither comming vpon him on the ſuddaine without his great preparation for them, did yet ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily preuaile, by the power of God going before them and with them, and the feare of God fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon the Spanyards (as ſometime vpon the Shechemites and their neighbour nations, Gen. 35. 5.) that comming not into any obſcure ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but to one of the moſt famous hauens in all Spayne, and finding the ſame furniſhed with a mightie Navie of the king his greateſt ſhippes, did not withſtanding both foile all the foreſaide Navie, and alſo land, not ſome, but as many of their men as themſelues would: and within few daies did both take and ſacke, not ſome little village, but one of the chiefeſt, richeſt, and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt townes in all his kingdome, ſtrongly forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with men, and plentifully furniſhed with victuall, and whereof (by report of them that were there, &amp; that know the place) euery houſe was built of ſtone, and in forme and ſtrength like vnto a caſtle. Thus did our God bleſſe and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14153:91"/> proſper our forces againſt him, with loſſe of no man of reckoning but onely one, and of no more of the common ſoldiours, then is moſt likely in ſo great a multitude would haue died at home. So did our armies returne, as with a ſufficient ſpoyle and bootie, ſo with exceeding great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and renowne. What ſhall we ſay of theſe things? that by our hand and ſtrength we haue gotten the victorie? God forbid that we ſhould ſo robbe God of his honour. But let vs more truly anſwer as the Apoſtle anſwereth the like queſtion of admiration with theſe wordes, <hi>If God be with vs, who can be againſt vs?</hi> Rom. 8. 31. Euen ſo let vs, touching the confuſion of the Spaniſh forces, and the gracious ſucceſſe of our owne, likewiſe anſwer and ſay, <hi>God hath beene with vs, therefore it skilleth not who hath beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs:</hi> and on the contrarie, <hi>God hath beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spanyard, and therefore it hath not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen him againſt vs, whomſoeuer he hath had with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5 A third example alſo of like mixt workes of God, againſt Pope and poperie, and for vs and our religion, is that ouerthrow which the laſt winter the Lord himſelfe, without any meanes of man, gaue to a great power of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſhippes, ſent towards Ireland for aide and ſtrengthening of the rebells againſt vs. This power of ſhippes, beeing not ſo much as exſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of vs, did the Lord by his mightie power ſo graciouſly confound in our behalfe, that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of their comming, till tidings came of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14153:92"/> their drowning. And may we not here alſo adde the happie ſucceſſe of our laſt voyage this preſent yeare againſt the Spanyard, as likewiſe the contrarie of the Spaniſh Navie againe ſent hither againſt vs? yes verily. Theſe doe no leſſe deſerue the regiſtring, then the former: theſe are as well worthie the obſeruation, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: finally theſe ſpeake as plainely for our religion and againſt poperie, as the former. For as touching this ſecond voyage of that moſt worthie and honourable Earle, albeit at the firſt God himſelfe ſeemed as it were to froune vpon vs and to reſiſt vs, (for the triall of the courage, and proouing the patience, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the better humiliation of the ſaide Earle and his forces) and finally for inſtructing of vs as well as the Spanyard, that the proceeding in any voyage muſt not be according to the will and pleaſure of man, but according to his will and pleaſure, that ruleth and gouerneth as well by ſea as by la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d:) yet afterward (all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) the Lord hath not much leſſe (if any whit leſſe at all) magnified his great mercies towards vs and his goſpel, and his iuſtice againſt Spayne and poperie, then he did the laſt yeare, at the taking and ſacking of Cales. For firſt of all, how honourably to the great reproch of the great King, hath our little Fleete diſcontinued from home, partly before, and partly about the dominions of Spayne, and that in the very face of the Spanyard? yet what hath all the Spaniſh power done vnto them? yea rather how cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14153:92"/> haue they kept themſelues within their ſafe hauens and harbours, not daring ſo much as once to looke our forces in the faces? did we ſo in the yeare 1588? doth not this ſpeake to the renowne of our little Iland, and eſpecially to the glorie of the religion therein profeſſed? doth it not in like manner as euidently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace both the Spanyards themſelues, and alſo their Romane religion? As touching the finall ſucceſſe of this voyage, although it were not ſuch as it might haue beene (becauſe God well ſeeth that ſo rich a bootie as the whole Indian ſleete had beene, would perhaps haue made vs too proud) yet ſuch was it, that we haue no loſſe, neither they any gaine thereby. Concerning the Spaniſh Navie, this yeare alſo ſent againſt vs, firſt how cowardly was it ſent, when they thought our ſtrength to haue beene from home? will not euery man vtterly condemne him for a cowarde, that taketh the aduantage priuily of his aduerſarie, when he thinketh him to be vnarmed? why therefore may not the like be ſaide of the like practiſe of a King and kingdome? eſpecially of ſuch a king and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as in their high pride thinke they ſhould commaund the whole world. Secondly what ſucceſſe had this Fleete, ſo priuily and cloſely thinking to haue ſtolne vpon vs? verily as he that kept England heretofore, hath neither ſlept nor ſlumbred, ſo now alſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Spa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>yards thought to haue founde vs aſleepe, they founde him waking. When they thought to haue found vs
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14153:93"/> vnarmed, they found him as a man of warre, with his ſword girded to his thigh, yea rather readie drawne in his hand, and euery way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the battaile. For this man of warre fought for vs againe this yeare, as he did the laſt yeare: and did partly confound them, and partly force them to recule home with all diſhonour; and that before that we did ſo much as once (almoſt) dreame of any ſuch power comming towardes vs. The more did God reueale his wrath againſt them and their errours; as alſo teſtifie his loue vnto vs, and to his owne truth.</p>
                  <p>6 In writing thus of theſe things, I boaſt not of our ſelues and our owne worthines, as if the Lord for our righteouſneſſe had done all theſe things forvs: I labour not to commend our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but onely to iuſtifie our religion. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelues, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny but that although we haue the goſpel, yet our contempt of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and his other mercies, our ſecuritie by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; our other manifold and heinous ſinnes which we daily commit againſt his maieſtie, are ſuch, that we haue beene and are altogether vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of ſo mightie protection, and of ſo proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſucceſſe. It hath not beene therefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our ſelues, that God hath thus dealt with vs and for vs: but onely for his owne great names ſake, and that he might yet further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his goſpell profeſſed amongſt vs (but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede not ſo practiſed and obeied by vs as it ought to be) vnto thoſe that yet regard it not,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14153:93"/> and that (if it be poſſible) he might winne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto both Atheiſts, and Papiſts, and alſo all other that yet are enemies thereof. Thus we condemne our ſelues, and thus we magnifie onely the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and goodnes of God, in regard whereof we wiſh as the Prophet often wiſheth in the 107, pſalme, <hi>that men would therefore confeſſe before the Lord, his louing kindnes, and his wonderfull workes that he doth before the ſonnes of men:</hi> we wiſh alſo as the Prophet doth again in the ſame pſalme, verſ. 22. that, <hi>men would offer ſacrifice of praiſe, and declare his works with reioycing.</hi> Let no man or woman therefore, how zealous ſoeuer of poperie they haue beene hitherto, and yet are: or how obſtinate and hard hearted ſoeuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our religion, ſo lightly paſſe by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſo baſely thinke of our religion, as they haue done or doe. Though we doe not honour it as we ought to doe, but rather diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it by our wicked liues and conuerſations, altogether vnbeſeeming the holines thereof: yet let them more ſeriouſly conſider theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby God himſelfe from heauen hath graced and commended and doth grace and commend the ſame vnto them.</p>
                  <p>7 Let no man here ſay, that by theſe laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from the works of God, the religion of the Turks might be iuſtified. For albeit it cannot be denied, that the Turke hath had mightie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, and doth flow in great proſperitie, yet is their great difference betweene our victories, and his: betweene our proſperitie and his. All
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14153:94"/> that he hath gotten hath beene by exceeding force and power: but our victories haue beene obtained almoſt without force, againſt great force. His victories haue neuer beene gotten without great loſſe of his owne ſide: but as the Iewes and Iſraelites oftentimes preuailed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fight at all, Iudg. 7. 20. 2. Chron. 20. 17. and 23. &amp;c. ſo in a manner haue we done. The Lord onely hath fought for vs, we almoſt haue not fought for our ſelues or for him, but onely haue ſhewed our faces to the enemie. As the Turke hath thus gotten that which he hath, ſo alſo he maintaineth his eſtate wholly by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: but as the Lord hath fought for vs from heauen, ſo alſo he miraculouſly maintaineth vs. The like may be ſaid of the other proſperitie of the Turke, becauſe he hath not thoſe mightie enemies to oppugne and envie it, which we haue had and yet haue, to enuie and oppugne ours. The ſame, and more alſo, may be ſaide of all the victories of the Spanyard himſelfe againſt other: he hath gotten all, he holdeth and keepeth all, partly by violence and crueltie, partly by falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode and treacherie. Therefore as the former great victories of Senacherib againſt other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereof Rabſhekah boaſteth, 2. King. 18. 34, 35, &amp;c. did the more iuſtifie and commend Hezekia, and the worſhip of God repaired and eſtabliſhed by him: ſo the great victories of the Spanyards againſt other nations either heathen or popiſh, maketh the more for vs and for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſith the Spanyard cannot by thoſe means
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14153:94"/> preuaile againſt vs, by which he hath preuailed againſt others, as great people as we are if not much greater. For what els doth this teach, but that <hi>the Lord himſelfe is our light and ſaluation, our ſtrength, our rocke and fortreſſe, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 27. 1. Pſal. 18. 1. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>vs.</hi> Surely <hi>the Lord is our ſtrength, and he that teacheth our hands to fight, and our fingers to battell, he is our goodnes &amp; for treſſe, our tower, and</hi>

                  <p>8 Yea but the Spanyard himſelfe hath alſo had great victories againſt the Turke, when the Turkiſh forces haue perhaps beene twiſe or thriſe ſo great as the Spaniſh. Let this be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet doth not this ſimply iuſtifie the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh religion, but onely in reſpect of the Turks, who are profeſſed enemies of Chriſt and of all that is called by the name of Chriſt. The Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites after the death of Ioſhua fell often to moſt grieuous idolatrie, the Lord gaue them not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding mightie victories againſt their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Yea the tenne Tribes after they were reuolted, not onely from Iuda, but alſo from the Lord himſelfe and his worſhip, and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: in their battels notwithſtanding with thoſe that profeſſed enmity both to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; alſo to god whome they ſometime had truly worſhipped, and of whoſe worſhip they retained ſome ſmall
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14153:95"/> remnants, had very great and happie ſucceſſe, though ſometimes their enemies were tenne times as many and as ſtrong as themſelues. Yet doe not theſe victories ſimply iuſtifie the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, or their preſent religion, but onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their enemies, which did vtterly denie God and his religion. The Lord notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their falling in moſt things, had regard to the remnants of his worſhip amongſt them, and to his formet couenant, euen for his owne names ſake, as Ezekiel teacheth, chap. 20. In like ſort the Spanyards profeſſing the name of Chriſt, and hauing ſome remnants of Chriſtian religion amongſt them, but the Turks vtterly denying and defying Chriſt, and the very name of all chriſtianitie: no maruaile though Chriſt Ieſus in the warres of the Spanyards againſt them, doe rather fight the battels of the Spanyards, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing reſpect vnto his name ſo blaſphemed by the Turke. But hereby doth not Chriſt Ieſus ſimply approoue of the Spaniſh religion, but onely in reſpect of the Turkiſh.</p>
                  <p>9 If it be further obiected, that the moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that are, doe ſometime preuaile againſt the godly themſelues, as the men of Ai againſt Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, &amp;c. and that they flow alſo in much, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all outward proſperitie, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this argument is not ſound and firme e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to inferre that which I inferre thereof, I anſwer that the Lord indeede giueth ſometime ſuch victorie vnto the wicked againſt his owne people, but it is for ſome ſpeciall ſinne of his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14153:95"/> people, as appeareth by the example before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged. For Iſrael fell before the men of Ai for the ſinne of Achan, yea the Lord ſaith they could not ſtand before their enemies, Ioſh. 7. 12. becauſe of that ſinne. Againe, though the Lord ſometimes giue his people ouer into the hands of his and their enemies, yet he doth it not in ſuch miraculous manner without the force of the enemie againſt them, himſelfe figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from heauen for the enemie, as he hath done for vs againſt the Spanyards, but alwaies the enemie hath preuailed againſt the Lord his people, by greater ſtrength of fleſh then the Lords people had againſt them, and by fighting in their owne perſon. For touching the former example of Ai, Ioſhua ſent but about 3000. of the Iſraelites againſt it, Ioſh. 7. 4. but it is moſt like that they were repelled by a farre more greater force. For although they whome Ioſhua firſt ſent to view Ai, returned and ſaide it was but a ſmall people, yet it is certen that they were able to make a greater force then three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, becauſe when Iſrael preuailed againſt Ai to the number of twelue thouſand, Ioſh. 8. 26. The ſame may be ſaide of the other proſperitie of the wicked, they proſper, they flouriſh, they waxe rich, &amp;c. but it is by ordinarie meanes: ſometime alſo, yea moſt commonly by vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes, by hooke and by crooke (as the prouerbe is:) but our proſperitie and the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of other kingdomes, countries, and cities, &amp;c. profeſſing our religion, haue ſo proſpered
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:14153:96"/> and flouriſhed in outward things, aboue that which they did whilſt they were ouergrowne with poperie, that euery man may euidently ſee, that it is the ſpeciall bleſſing of God euen for the honour of our religion, that hath made vs rich and thus to proſper. Againe we haue thus proſpered, though the wicked Papiſts haue ſeene our proſperitie, and beene angrie; yea though they haue practiſed againſt vs and gnaſhed their teeth. Pſal. 37. 12. and 112. 10.</p>

                  <p>THeſe things now written, and whereby I haue prooued the falſhood of poperie, and likewiſe ſhewed the truth of our religion, I wiſh profitable vnto all: both to thoſe that profeſſe themſelues of our religion, and alſo to thoſe that neither are, nor profeſſe themſelues to be. Of thoſe that profeſſe themſelues to be of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſome are faint, weake, and wauering: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are ſtrong, and well grounded, or at the leaſt ſuch as haue neuer doubted our religion to be of God. The firſt ſort I doe now wiſh to be as the ſecond, that is, by theſe things that now I haue written, ſo confirmed and eſtabliſhed in the loue, liking, and conſtant profeſſion of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſo keeping (as it were by force againſt all force whereby they ſhall be aſſaulted) this profeſſion of their hope, Hebr. 10. 23. without wauering, that hereafter they be neuer carried about with diuers and ſtrange doctrines, Hebr. 13. 9. yea both theſe ſorts of profeſſours of our religion, I wiſh to be much ſtronger in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, aſſuring themſelues that ſo long as this religion abideth in them, ſo long they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſhall continue in the ſonne, and in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Hebr. 2. 24. and ſo long as they walke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this religion, ſo long they walke with God as Enoch did, Gen. 5. 22. But foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as our religion is of God and acceptable

Let no man therefore that hath giuen his name to our religion deceiue himſelfe, neither ſuffer himſelfe to be deceiued by any other, either Papiſt or Atheiſt, or of any other ſect or hereſie: for ſurely it is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God, Heb. 10. 31. it had beene better for ſuch neuer to haue knowne the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, then after they haue knowne it to turne from the holy comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements giuen vnto them, 2.

                  <p>2 Neither would I haue this to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood onely of the ſoundnes and conſtancie of iudgement in our religion, but alſo of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall abounding in the workes of the Lord, 1.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14153:99"/> Princes, as haue done and doe daily ſpeake and doe ſo much for Chriſt in his goſpel and in his members, that they giue great incouragement to all perſons of place fitte to haue acceſſe vnto them, without feare to put them in continuall remembrance of further honouring of Chriſt? If he were ſo bold for Chriſt Ieſus beeing deade, how much bolder ought all men to be for Chriſt Ieſus raiſed vp from the dead? yea verily he is twiſe riſen againe: once touching his bodie out of the ſepulchre, into which the ſame Ioſeph did honourably lay him: and againe touching his goſpel out of the graue of poperie, wherein it had lien twiſe ſo many hundred yeares (at the leaſt) as his bodie had lien daies and nights in the former ſepulchre. How zealous therefore ought men to be for the honouring of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt Ieſus with true honour, wherein Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe thus raiſed vp and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cannot but be likewiſe honoured? As ſuch men ought to be thus zealous, in ſpeaking for Chriſt and his goſpel at all times, ſo eſpecially then ought they to be moſt zealous, when any ſpeciall occaſion requireth the ſame, or when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpeciall opportunitie is offered thereunto. Salomon ſaith, <hi>How good is a word spoken in due ſeaſon?</hi> Prov. 5. 25. He ſpeaketh this by queſtion and admiration, and thereby teacheth, that he himſelfe, the wiſeſt that euer was (Chriſt onely excepted) could not well expreſſe, how good a word was ſpoken in due ſeaſon.

Where any noble, honourable, or other great perſon, ſeeth any conuenient time where his word may doe good to further religion, &amp; thereby to aduance God his glorie, let him thinke with himſelfe as Mordecaie ſpake vnto Eſter, Eſter 4. 14. who knoweth whither the Lord hath thus aduanced me for this time?</p>
                  <p>2 Neither let any ſuch perſon feare the loſſe of their labour touching themſelues, in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in ſuch cauſes. God whoſe religion ours is, hath ſaide by his Prophet, 1. Sam. 2. 30. <hi>Them that honour me I will honour:</hi> and, <hi>he is faithfull that hath promiſed,</hi> Hebr. 10. 23. This is manifeſt by many of the examples before mentioned. The fruit indeede of ſuch labour, doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies appeare preſently: yet God is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous that he ſhould forget the worke and labour of ſuch loue towardes his name, &amp;c. Hebr. 6. 10. but he taketh ſuch a note thereof, yea of the leaſt word ſpoken this waie, that it ſhall moſt certenly be remembred to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons themſelues or to their poſteritie euen in this life, and touching the benefites thereof,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14153:100"/> when all the world ſhall thinke it buried, and euen (as it were) wholly conſumed to aſhes in the graue of obliuion. It was not much that Iethro the father in law of Moſes did, called al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Keni, Iudg. 1. 16. and of whome deſcended the Kenites: it was not much (I ſay) that this Iethro or Keni did for the Iſraelites. For he did but onely giue counſaile to Moſes his ſonne in law for the better gouernement of the Iſraelites, Exod. 18. 19. yet note what note the Lord kept of this ſmall matter. After the death of Moſes, after the death of Ioſhua, and the elders that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerliued Ioſhua, after the death of Othniel, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hud, Shamgar, Debora, Gedeon, and the reſt of the Iudges that iudged Iſrael mentioned in the whole booke of Iudges, after the death of Eli and his ſonnes, after the gouernment of Samuel reſigned into the hands of Saul: after all this, euen foure hundred yeares after the former counſell giuen by Iethro to Moſes, did the Lord thinke vpon this kindnes, and recompenced it tenne fold to the Kenites the poſteritie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro. Yea rather then it ſhould not be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced, he raiſed vp Saul to recompence the ſame, euen vnnaturall, vnthankfull, and moſt cruell Saul, that had ſworne the death of his owne ſonne Ionathan, 1. Sam. 14. 44. who had ſaued Iſrael, and would indeede haue killed him, had not the people reſcued him, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward did daily hunt for the life of Dauid as for a partridge in the mountaines, 1. Sam. 26. 20. (who had notwithſtanding killed the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14153:101"/> great Goliah whome all Iſrael durſt not looke in the face, 1. Sam. 17. 24. and gotten many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther victories of the Philiſtims, and married Saul his owne daughter:) that alſo killed all the Lord his prieſts at once, 1. Sam, 22. 18. euen this bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die man did the Lord raiſe vp to recompenſe the kindnes of Iethro, and to ſaue the liues of all the Kenites. Yea though this Saul were a man moſt vnmercifull vnto them, to whome he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much mercie and other loue, yet the Lord ſo wrought his heart, for the recompencing of that that Iethro had done to Moſes and for Iſrael, that he was very earneſt with the Kenites for the withdrawing themſelues from the Amala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites, that he might not deſtroy them with the Amalakites. Therefore he ſaith not onely <hi>Goe,</hi> but alſo <hi>depart,</hi> yea alſo he addeth, <hi>Get ye downe from, among the Amalakites, leaſt I deſtroy you with them.</hi> And why is he thus mercifull vnto them? <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye ſhewed mercy to all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, when they came vp from Egypt,</hi> 1. Sam. 15. 6. Certenly this mercie whereof ſuch a ſtreame did flow from Saul towards the Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, was onely of the Lord, not of Saul him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Saul of himſelfe (as we haue heard) was as the ſtonie rocke in the wildernes, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Lord made to giue drinke ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully to the Iſraelites and their cattell, Numb. 20. 8. Saul of himſelfe had neither the religion nor the manners, to conſider greater things done by thoſe that were of his owne blood, for himſelfe and for the preſent generation of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14153:101"/> Iſraelites. Shall we then thinke that he had reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or manners to remember ſuch olde good turnes, done ſo many yeares before for the old forefathers of the Iſraelites? Nowe what doth this example teach vs, but that the Lord is iuſt to remember the like kindnes, when all men ſhall thinke it vtterly forgotten? yea &amp; to make ſuch to conſider the ſame, as from whome in reſpect of their contrarie diſpoſition, no ſuch matter can in reaſon be hoped for, but rather the contrarie feared?</p>

Notwithſtanding as the cauſe is not their owne but the Lords, ſo I wiſh and exhort them not to ſeeke their owne praiſe and glorie, but the praiſe and glorie of him whoſe cauſe they handle, &amp; whoſe battels they fight. Ioab in fighting againſt Rabbah a citie of the Ammonites, did more reſpect the honour of Dauid then of himſelfe: and therefore though he might haue taken it without Dauid, yet he would not, but ſent firſt for Dauid, that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie might not be attributed to himſelfe but vnto Dauid. 2. Sam. 12. 28. If Ioab a wicked man, did ſo notwithſtanding reſpect the honour of Dauid aboue his owne honour (and yet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid though he were his ſoueraigne was but a mortall man, &amp; but a type of Chriſt Ieſus) how much more ought our Chriſtian worthies and nobles to reſpect the praiſe, the honour, and the glorie of Chriſt Jeſus himſelfe, aboue their owne praiſe, honour, &amp; glorie? Further beſides this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Chriſt his glorie, let them alſo goe forth

And therefore as it hath beene chriſtianly prouided by our moſt chriſtian Prince &amp; the gouernours of our church vnder her, that there ſhould be publike praiers in behalfe of ſuch expeditions againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon aduerſaries, ſo I wiſh alſo our noble Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies moſt highly to eſteeme of ſuch praiers: yea themſelues alſo before their going forth, and whilſt they ſhall be forth, alwaies to commend all their enterprizes vnto the Lord by moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt praier, yea to make alſo all the friends they can at home in like manuer to remember them priuately, as by publique authoritie they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred publiquely. For certenly as hitherto we are not to doubt, but that our chiefe ſucceſſe hath beene more by theſe meanes, then by any ſtrength of our owne arme, ſo alſo let them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelues, that if they goe forth in this ſort, then the Lord will not onely ſend his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel with them, as he offered to doe for the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, Exod. 33. 2. but will alſo goe with them himſelfe as it were in proper perſon: not onely to looke on how they fight for him, but alſo to teach their handes to fight and their fingers to battell: yea the Lord will be as a man of warre to goe before them, in the middes of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them, and round about them in complete harneſſe, both to couer their heads in the dai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14153:103"/> deliuer his owne and their enemies into their hands, as he hath done. Now if the Lord be thus with them, who can be againſt them? But yet one thing more remaineth, concerning both ſuch Worthies themſelues, and alſo all common ſoldiers, namely that as they haue heard and ſeene by this that hath beene written, that all warre in behalfe of our religion is God his warre, and in his cauſe: ſo alſo they take heede, that whilſt they fight one way for our religion and for God, they fight not an other way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt religion and againſt God himſelfe. How is this? verily by tranſgreſſing, violating, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the precepts of this religion, and that way ſinning againſt God. For he that doth ſo, fighteth more againſt religion, &amp; againſt God, then for religion and for God. Therefore the Scripture plentifully teacheth vs, that God hath oftentimes giuen ouer his owne people for their ſinnes, yea once alſo his Arke to captiuitie of the common enemie: yea his temple where his name was called vpon to be deſtroied, and all the holy veſſells and other ornaments of the temple, which ſometime had ſerued for his worſhip, to be polluted and defiled by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heathen. Let all ſuch Worthies therefore as before I haue ſpoken of, as likewiſe all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſoldiers, which ſhall hereafter be emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the common enemie, diligently take heede and beware of all ſinne generally, and more ſpecially of ſuch ſinnes as are moſt common in warriours (what theſe are I neede
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14153:104"/> not to ſpeake) becauſe otherwiſe, though their cauſe be good, and commended likewiſe in ſome ſort by praier vnto God by themſelues and by other, yet may they feare the ſucceſſe of the battell. This is manifeſt by the double ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the other Iſraelites had before the Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamits in a cauſe very iuſt, and commended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to God, and that with weeping the ſecond time: and wherein at the firſt they alſo preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hauing humbled themſelues in praier and faſting and true repentance before the Lord, Iudg. 20. 26. Now the ſinne of the Iſraelites, for which they receiuing ſuch a double foyle, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the text to haue beene, firſt too much confidence of the victorie, in regard partly of the goodnes of their cauſe, partly of their great multitude; and ſecondly that although they ſought vnto god in that behalfe, yet they ſought not in ſuch humble and earneſt manner as they ſhould haue done, and alſo did at the laſt, when they had not onely warrant from God to goe againe to battell, but alſo a promiſe of victorie. Now if theſe ſinnes be ſo dangerous to a good and iuſt cauſe, what may be feared of great ſinnes? Thus much ſhall ſuffice to haue ſpoken concerning them that are of our religion.</p>

To this ſort of Atheiſts, I doe alſo referre many ciuill men that neuer knew or heard of Machiuel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, neither of his precepts, which come alſo to Church, &amp;c. and liue likewiſe vprightly as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ciuill righteouſnes and outward equitie amongſt their neighbours, which will alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times talke of religion both ours and poperie, and yet in truth alſo are of no religion at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proteſtants nor Papiſts.

                  <p>TO Papiſts alſo I ſaie the ſame, eſpecially to ſuch as are Papiſts in a kind of conſcience, that is, to ſuch as are not of that religion of any obſtinate and wilfull minde, but becauſe in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance they are perſwaded their religion to be the right waie, and ours to be a wrong or by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie. I doubt not but that there are many ſuch in the land. Yea I hope that many Papiſts are ſuch. This I doe hope of ſuch Papiſts, as bring not forth thoſe fruits that poperie approoueth of, whereof I haue ſpoken in my ſixt argument
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14153:106"/> before, which are alſo mercifull and readie to doe good, not to them onely of their owne reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but alſo to other. Theſe I hope to be rather ignorant then wilfull Papiſts: therefore I haue alſo ſome good hope of their conuerſion in time, eſpecially if it might pleaſe God to mooue their hearts, to haue regard of the perfect law of god which conuerteth the ſoule, Pſal. 19. 7. And truly in the Chriſtian loue that I beare vnto theſe, and in the pittie and compaſſion I haue of their ſoules (as I ſee them full of pittie and compaſſion towards the bodies of other, and likewiſe to haue many other excellent &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable things in them) I haue the rather ſet penne to paper for the writing of this treatiſe, to trie if it might pleaſe my good God to bleſſe my labour vnto their good, euen to the winning of them to our religion. For I proteſt vnto them (and God knoweth I ſpeake the truth of my heart, and lie not neither diſſemble) that I ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their ſaluation, that I would be gladder thereof then of all worldly wealth and good whatſoeuer. In the meane time me thinketh, that howſoeuer they be commended for many excellent things indeede not very common, yet all their commendation is very defectiue and lame, for want of commendation touching true religion. Yea certenly when a man hath ſaide all that he can in commending ſuch perſons, and then ſaith that theſe were excellent men, or worthie women, were it not for one thing, that is, for their religion, this one thing wanting is
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14153:106"/> more then all they haue. For this one thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth God, &amp; all the other for which Papiſts are commonly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, concerne but men. And our Sauiour ſaith, that the great and firſt or chiefeſt commandement, is to loue the Lord our God, &amp;c. Math. 22. 38. yea this is ſo great, that the other without this concerning men, not being grounded vpon this, are not onely litle, but in truth touching themſelues, nothing at all. For Chriſt calleth this not onely the greater, but alſo the firſt commandement. Now where there is no firſt, there can be no ſecond. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I hoping this want of true religion in them, to be (as I ſaide) eſpecially of ignorance, doe therefore the better hope of their more eaſie conuerſion, and doe the more heartily wiſh the ſame, that there may be no ſuch defect in their commendation as there is, but that it may be more full and perfect. Such therefore hauing vouchſafed to reade my former arguments, I doe alſo moſt heartily deſire according to right to iudge of them. Some I haue heard to haue renounced poperie, vpon the ſight of the great ouerthrow of the great Spaniſh Navie in our narrow ſeas, anno 1588. by the mightie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God in our behalfe: as Rahab hearing of the great and mightie works of God for the Iſraelites, renounced her owne people, and was incorporated into the bodie of Iſrael, Ioſ. 2. 11.

Let none therefore ſo lightly regard all ſuch things, as whereby our religion is ſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and poperie ſo euidently euicted.</p>
                  <p>2 Let none oppoſe the religion of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and forefathers, &amp;c. to all other contrarie arguments. Indeede Dauid exhorteth Salomon to know the God of his father, and to ſerue him with a perfect heart, and with a willing minde, &amp;c. 1. Chron. 28. 9. and this is an excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for all fathers to giue vnto their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and likewiſe for all children to learne of their fathers, when as the fathers haue knowne &amp; ſerued the ſame God that Dauid had knowne and ſerued, and that according to his word, as Dauid had done: but if ſo be the fathers know not, neither ſerue that God, or not in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that God requireth; then it is a fooliſh and wicked inſtruction to be vrged to the children by the fathers, or to be obeied by the children, namely to know and ſerue the God of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>3 For when fathers haue rebelled againſt God, &amp; not walked in his ſtatutes and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then the Lord oftentimes complaineth of the children that haue walked in ſuch ſteppes of their fathers, and therefore alſo threatneth the greater and heauier iudgement againſt them. In the 78. pſal. v. 57. the Prophet complaineth of the wickednes of the Iſraelites, and amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame by like example of their fathers,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14153:109"/> 
                     <hi>They turned backe</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>and dealt falſly like their fathers, they turned backe like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull bowe.</hi> So Chriſt alſo ſpeaketh vnto the Iewes, as to a people paſt hope, &amp; therefore bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to fulfill alſo the meaſure of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Math. 23. 32. So likewiſe Steuen amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſinne of the Iewes by the like example of their fathers, <hi>Ye ſtiffnecked and vncircumciſed hearts and eares, ye haue alwaies reſiſted the holy Ghoſt, as your fathers did, ſo doe ye, &amp;c.</hi> Act. 7. 51. Therefore alſo the Lord many times admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth the Iſraelites and Iewes not to walke in the waies, neither to doe the works of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Harden not your hearts</hi> (ſaith one Prophet) <hi>as in the daie of contention</hi> (or tentation) <hi>in the wildernes, where your fathers tempted me, &amp;c.</hi> pſal. 59. 8. By an other Prophet God ſpeaketh thus, <hi>I ſaide vnto their children in the wildernes, walke ye not in the ordinances of your fathers, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerue their manners, neither defile your ſelues with their idolls,</hi> Ezech. 20. 18. So the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers that Hezekiah ſent forth to inuite the Iſraelites to the Paſſeouer at Ieruſalem, bidde them not to be like their fathers, &amp;c. neither ſtiffnecked like their fathers, &amp;c. 2. Chron. 30. 7, 8. In like ſort ſpeaketh Zachariah, <hi>Be ye not like your fathers, &amp;c.</hi> Zachar. 1. 4. Many other the like places are in the ſcriptures, whereby we ſee this argument not to be good; This was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of our fathers, therefore it ſhall be ours.</p>
                  <p>4 Yea certenly this is the very argument of many obſtinate Iewes, for the defence of their
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14153:110"/> idolatrie, <hi>The word that thou haſt spoken vnto vs in the name of the Lord we will not heare it of thee, but we will doe whatſoeuer thing goeth out of our owne mouth, to burne incenſe vnto the Queene of heauen, and to poure out drinke offerings vnto her, as we haue done, both we &amp; our forefathers,</hi> Ier. 44. 16, 17. Thus anſwered the wicked Iewes, and thus anſwered many Papiſts, ſaying, they will not heare the word of God, but will praie to the virgin Marie (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they call indeed the Queene of heauen, as hath bin ſhewed before) and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch heauenly things, for no other reaſon; but becauſe they and their fathers haue done ſo. But ſuch Papiſts as loue their owne ſaluation, I exhort in the Lord, not to be ſo wedded to the religion of their fathers. Will any of you ſay thus, My father was a ttaytour to his Prince, and was therefore executed, therefore I alſo will be a traytour to my Prince, that I may beheaded, drawne, hanged, and quartered, as my father was? Some it may be, will not ſticke to ſay ſo: but all that are wiſe, will take heede of ſuch words and thoughts. Therefore why alſo will you ſay, My father was a Papiſt, and idolatour, and of that religion that God hath condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſo conſequently a traytour vnto God, therefore alſo will I be ſo? will any of you ſay, eſpecially ſuch as God hath aduanced to great honour, or worſhip, and wealth in the land, My father or grandfather was a ſadler, or butcher, or graſier, or husbandman, or of ſome other the like meane trade, therefore alſo I will be ſo? I
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14153:110"/> thinke none ſo fooliſh: why then will ye ſay the like and ten times worſe in religion? will any of you ſaie, My father, or my mother, or both, had this or that bodily diſeaſe, and died thereof for want of remedie, therefore alſo I feeling the like in my ſelfe, will not be cured of it though I may? I thinke none ſo madde. Why then will ye ſay the like, touching ſuch a grieuous ſpirituall ſickneſſe of your ſoules, as poperie is? why will ye die in your ſinnes, and not be ſaued, O ye Papiſts, and many other that are not yet of our religion?</p>
                  <p>5 Neither doe I ſay theſe things, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning yours and my forefathers. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne not them, but I condemne their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. As for themſelues I leaue them vnto the Lord, as not knowing whither they ſecretly repented or no of their poperie before their end. If they did not repent, it is farre more better to condemne them, then to condemne the worde of God of any vntruth, and God himſelfe of any vnrighteouſneſſe. Be ye not therefore like the adder that ſtoppeth his eares, refuſing to heare the voice of the charmer, charme he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo wiſely. Be ye not vnlike vnto the firſt world, that ſeeing how miraculouſly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to nature, the lyons, beares, woolfes, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, elephants, vnicomes, hares, conies, and ſuch like cruell and wilde beaſts: the ſwallows alſo, kytes, rauens, oſtriches, eagles, and many other the like wilde and rauening birdes, came willingly and gently without any outwarde
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14153:111"/> force compelling them to Noah, to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the arke with him and with his familie, Gen. chap. 7 verſ. 7. would not yet beleeue, and therefore were drowned in the waters. Be ye not like the Egyptians, and many alſo of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, that ſeeing the great works of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Egypt, and for the land of Zoan, would not yet beleeue, and therefore periſhed; the one in the redde ſea, the other in the wildernes. Be ye not like the Iewes, that did ſee the great and mightie workes done by our Sauiour and his Apoſtles for commending his goſpell, and yet would not beleeue, and are therefore ſcattered vpon the face of the earth, out of their owne countrey vnto this day; and that which is worſe, are giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer alſo to hardnes of heart, &amp; wil not yet beleeue that the Chriſt and Meſſias is come.</p>
                  <p>6 Verily God hath commended our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as we haue before ſhewed) to your eares, to your eies, to your vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, to your inward, to your outward, to your whole man. Take heed, take heede therefore that ye harden your hearts no longer. Ye haue heard many arguments drawne from the word of God, ye haue ſeene and doe daily ſee his workes againſt your owne religion and for ours: O therefore ſtop not your eares, ſhut not your eyes. Yea, ye your ſelues, (O ye that will be called Catholiques) haue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and doe fare the better for our religion in England. Ye your ſelues are partakers of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, whereby the Lord hath graced it and doth grace it: ye liue in much peace for our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14153:111"/> ſake, ye enioy your honours and dignities by our religion: yea, ye keepe and encreaſe your liuings the better for our religion. For though ſome of you perhaps will ſay, that ye pay two hundred and fourtie pound a yeare for your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet if ye were throughly examined, and would truly anſwer, ye could not denie, but that vnder pretenſe of this payment, ye ſaue twiſe ſo much an other waie. For this is certen, that none doe purchaſe more lands, build goodlier houſes, and hoard vp more money, then ſome of them that paie the foreſaid ſumme yearely. Thinke not that it ſhould be better with you if the Spanyard might here preuaile: ye are wiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſee how vaine ſuch thoughts are, by his dealing in other places, where he hath wonne the goale. Doe ye alſo hope of ſome better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, if poperie were againe here reuiued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spanyard? perhaps ye ſhould be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, partly by the old greedines of the Pope, the rather beeing now like an hungerſtarued curre, that for his long want of the crummes, bones, yea and good gobbets of meat that were wont to fall from the tables of England to his ſhare, would now be inſatiable: partly and eſpecially by ſome other iudgements of God that would follow poperie. Sith therefore ye enioy ſuch benefits by vs and our religion, as Laban fared the better for Iacob, Gen. 30, 30. and Potiphar for Ioſeph, Gen. 39. 5. be not ſo vnrighteous, as any longer to condemne that which God doth iuſtifie. Be not ſo vnthankfull, as any longer to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14153:112"/> refuſe his great mercie, in calling you by ſuch commendations of our religion to the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thereof. Now I ſay vnto you as Paul ſaith vnto Timothie, 2. Tim. 2. 7. <hi>Conſider what I ſay, and the Lord giue you vnderſtanding in all things.</hi> Yea ſuch vnderſtanding, as that I and all other that deſire your ſaluation may reioyce, that the angels in heauen may reioyce, and eſpecially that your ſelues may reioyce with ioy vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and glorious.</p>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14153:112"/> word or deede ſhewed to his people) at the laſt, though it ſeeme to belong, certenly the Lord euen in this life will meete with them or theirs, for their ſinne againſt his name, and wrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any of his ſeruants. In the 8. of Amos, v. 7. the Prophet telleth them that had deuoured and ſwallowed the poore, by their extreame dealing with them in ſelling their corne at an vnreaſonable price vnto them (as too too many doe in this time of dearth amongſt vs) that the Lord had <hi>ſworne by the excellencie of Jaacob</hi> (that is, euen by himſelfe) <hi>that he would neuer forget that crueltie.</hi> Obſerue, good reader, orrather let ſuch obſerue as of whome I ſpeake, that he ſaith not, that the Lord had ſaid onely he would not forget, but that the Lord had ſworne it by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, teaching therby, that except they did ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily repent, the Lord would moſt certenly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh that their great ſinne, becauſe euery word of God is certen, much more that word the which he confirmeth by an oath.

The example of God his iudgements vpon diuers malicious Papiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, doe teſtifie the ſame. So alſo doe many examples in the ſcriptures. Though the ſinnes generally of Ahab and Iezebel his wife were many, yet the Lord threatned ruine vnto them both and to all their poſteritie, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their ſinne againſt righteous Naboth, 1. King. 21. 20. the which was ſo fully executed by Iehu according to the word of the Lord, that they paid moſt deerely for Naboth his vineyard, 2. King. 9. 27, 33. &amp; 10. 6. Though Ioaſh king of Iuda committed many ſinnes after the death of good Iehoiada the high prieſt, yet his putting to death of the Prophet Zechariah the ſonne of the ſame Iehoiada, is onely mentioned as the chiefe cauſe why his owne ſeruants conſpired againſt him and murthered him, 2. Chron. 24. 25. Though Haman had not fully effected his bloodie purpoſe againſt Mordecai and the other Iewes, yet we know that the ſame meaſure by the righteous iudgement of God was meaſured vnto him, that he had onely intended to haue meaſured vnto Mordecai, Eſt. 7. 10.</p>
                  <p>3 Here eſpecially let vs remember how God dealt with the Amalekites, onely for withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Iſraelites as they came out of the land of Egypt, Exod. 17. 8. Firſt although the Lord
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14153:113"/> did diſcomfort them before the Iſraelites at the praier of Moſes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they firſt came out againſt Iſrael, yet did not the Lord ſatisfie himſelfe with their ouerthrow of that daie, but preſently he ſpake further againſt them vnto Moſes, verſ. 14. ſaying, <hi>Write for a remembrance in the booke, and rehearſe it to Ioſhua, for I will vtterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from vnder heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Nomb. 24. 20. Yea but perhaps theſe were but words. Words indeede they were, but yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when that generation of the Amalekites which then liued, and foure other at the leaſt were dead and rotten, thoſe words were fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For as long after this, as before we heard that God remembred the kindnes of the Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites for their good, the ſame God alſo remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that ſinne of the Amalekites to their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. For he ſendeth Samuel with this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date and commiſſion to Saul againſt Amalek, 1. Sam. 15. 2. <hi>I remember what Amalek did to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, how they laide waite for them in the way, as they came vp from Egypt: now therefore goe and ſmite Amalek, and deſtroy all that pertaineth vnto them, and haue no compaſſion on them, but ſtay both man and woman, both infant and ſuckling, both oxe and ſheepe, both camell and aſſe.</hi> This was
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14153:114"/> foure hundred yeares after the former ſinne committed. A man therefore would haue thought, that God had not nowe any more thought vpon it, for all his former note of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. But the Lord remembereth when men forget, and thinke alſo all to be forgotten. Yea the Lord did ſo remember this ſinne, and doth ſo remember other the like ſinnes, as that if he forbeare the puniſhment for a time, yet at the laſt he commeth in alſo for arrearages. For in the former commiſſion giuen to Saul, we ſee with what ſeueritie the Lord will haue Saul to proceede againſt the Amalekites. Yea after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the ſame chapter, when Saul had beene too remiſſe in the execution of that commiſſion, the Lord raiſed vp Samuel to doe or ſee that to be done againſt Agag the king of Amalek, that Saul had neglected.</p>
                  <p>4 If therefore there ſhall be any ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts or Atheiſts, as by no meanes will be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and drawne to our religion, in this treatiſe commended and prooued to be of God and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto him, yet at the leaſt let them take heede and beware of ſpeaking the leaſt word, and doing the leaſt deede againſt it, or againſt any that loue and maintaine the ſame, for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and maintaining thereof. Let them not flatter themſelues. God is the ſame now that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he was.

               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:14153:116"/> alſo their owne ſyllables, their owne letters, their owne points. For as nigh as I could (&amp; yet in ſome things I may ſlippe, becauſe I found it an harder matter to ſet downe their falſe manner of writing, then if all things had beene truly penned by them) as nigh, I ſay, as I could, I haue written all things in this addition (abbreuiations onely excepted) in the very ſame ſort that I finde them writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their owne bookes. Let not therefore the Chriſtian and learned teader be here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, either with the rudenes of the latine it ſelfe, or with the falſe manner of writing thereof, without obſeruation of any rules of orthographie. For as ſentences are written here without any true points, as I haue ſet downe the words themſelues, without dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thongs, without great letters for the moſt part at the beginning of ſentences, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of proper names one letter alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for an other, as K for C, Y for I, and ſuch like, and aduerbs that ſhould be accented without any accents, as (I ſay) theſe things are ſet downe by me; ſo did I finde them, &amp; ſo ſhall the reader finde them in auncient books out of which I haue taken them. And thus I haue the rather done, that thereby their ignorance, their blindnes, and rudenes, euen in the latine tongue (whereof notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they made moſt profeſſion) might the more euidently appeare euen to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that haue learned any rules of gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14153:117"/> Touching the matter it ſelfe of theſe things here added, it is either ſo blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that it will make any chriſtian heart to tremble at the reading or hearing thereof; or ſo fooliſh and ridiculous, that any man of reaſon, will think it more fit for a ſtage, then for the Church, the place of God his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to make ſport withall, rather then to haue the name of religion. In this additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the moſt part I haue ſet downe the latine it ſelfe, that ſo all men may the leſſe ſuſpect my faithfulneſſe in reporting their wordes. Notwithſtanding ſometime, when there is no ſpeciall thing in the latin, either for phraſe, or for manner of writing, worthie the noting, and eſpecially when the latin is very long, I haue for breuities ſake, either altogether omitted the latin, or onely ſet downe the beginning thereof, ſometimes alſo noting ſome ſpecial words in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. Now although this addition may at the firſt ſeeme ſomewhat large, yet to the reader it neede not be very painfull, for that one halfe is in a manner the whole: becauſe if the reader be learned, vnderſtanding the latin tongue, then he may read the latin onely, omitting the engliſh. If the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der know no other tongue then the eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, then the reading onely of the engliſh will be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Now to come to the things themſelues, which here I purpoſe to adde, I will firſt beginne with their popiſh ſeruice
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14153:117"/> bookes, and proceede from them to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of ſome of their chiefe Doctours, and finally conclude this whole addition with ſome of the miracles of the virgin Marie. Now becauſe their ſeruice bookes are full of many blaſphemies, as wherein they giue ſo many of God his peculiar attributes vnto the Saints, eſpecially to the virgin Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe that follow are ſuch, that it may be many did neuer thinke ſo fooliſh and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſtuffe had beene in their bookes, vntill they did ſee their owne wordes.</p>

            <p>In all this rithme they doe nothing but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the right and left hand, as alſo the right and left foote of Chriſt pierced with nailes, and likewiſe his ſide thruſt through with a ſpeare. They doe onely (I ſay) ſalute theſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14153:122"/> members of Chriſt thus wounded for vs, with an All haile. Then which what can be more ridiculous? For not to ſpeake how childiſh a thing it is, to ſpeake any thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe members of Chriſt his materiall bodie, thus ſeuerally conſidered, and that without any the like examples of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, euen when they did ſee Chriſt bodily preſent after his reſurrection, both whilſt he was conuerſant and alſo when he aſcended vp into the heauens before them; it is alſo a very toye to bidde all haile, either vnto them, or vnto any other thing in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. For what is the meaning of All haile? truly either it is a phraſe of wiſhing well vnto that whereunto it is ſpoken, or it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth to reioyce and be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> merrie.

            <p>14 In the very next praier in the ſame booke made to the virgin Marie, they giue her the ſame titles which before in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe I haue collected out of their more aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient bookes.

To this I anſwer firſt, that if there be any ſuch reuocation and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the foreſaide ridiculous toyes and horrible blaſphemies, becauſe they were ridiculous and blaſphemous, then thereby it is graunted, that the time hath beene when the Church of Rome was a fooliſh and blaſphemous Church, and their religion likewiſe fooliſh and blaſphemous. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, what needed they to haue reuoked ſuch things or to haue made any reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them? Secondly, I demand where this reuocation and reformation is. They wil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14153:131"/> wonder at this demaund, ſith I my ſelfe haue before named their late booke intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>officium beatae Mariae virginis nuper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatum, &amp; pij quinti pontificis maximi iuſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

They will perhaps referre me to this booke it ſelfe, as pretended to be reformed; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the preface thereunto prefixed by the ſaid pepe Pius, wherein is a kinde of reuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome former ſeruices of the virgin.</p>
               <p>7 Touching the booke it ſelfe, I doe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeat my anſwer before made, namely that this booke is but onely ſaid and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be reformed, and not reformed in truth at the leaſt of the ſubſtantiall points moſt to be regarded. This is manifeſt by ſuch ridiculous &amp; blaſphemous praiers, as I haue before noted out of the ſame booke, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining therein. Therefore in ſetting this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the booke, <hi>The ſeruice of the Virgin lately reformed;</hi> they doe but as many a falſe taylour doth with the garment which he hath marred in making: and as ſome careles cooks with the meate which they ſerue vnto their maſters table, not throughly roſted or boiled. As the taylour beeing blamed for the fault of the garment, promiſeth to mende it, &amp; taking it home with him, bringeth it againe facing out the owner that he hath mended it, when he neuer did any thing more vnto it then at
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:14153:131"/> the firſt, at leaſt to any purpoſe: and as the cooke beeing rebuked for his negligence, oftentimes notwithſtanding ſendeth in the meat the ſecond time as better roſted or boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when either he neuer did put it againe on the ſpit or into the pot, or if he did that yet it had neuer a turne more nor any more ſeething: euen ſo the church of Rome being iuſtly blamed for the groſſe and foule blottes of their former ſeruice bookes, haue taken it againe into their ſhoppe or kitchin, but yet returned it vnto vs, or rather vnto their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris and ladie, onely giuing this word <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum,</hi> reformed, that is, facing vs or rather their miſtris and ladie, <hi>omnia eſſe bene,</hi> that is, that all things are well, when in truth the chiefe and moſt principall abſurdities and blaſphemies doe yet remaine.</p>
               <p>8 Concerning the preface vnto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer booke ſo pretended to be reformed, I graunt that therein ſeemeth to be a kinde of reuocation or diſanulling of ſome former ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice <note place="margin">The auncient popiſh ſeruice bookes before mentioned, are not now diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or reuoked by the church of Rome.</note> bookes, but not of ſuch ſeruice bookes, as out of which I haue gathered the things before ſet downe. For in the ſame preface, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reuocation and diſanulling of their former ſeruice bookes which it doth reuoke and diſanull, followeth a very large excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of three branches: <hi>the firſt, is of bookes printed in the latin tongue: the ſecond of bookes whoſe inſtitution was expreſſely approoued and allowed by the Apoſtolike ſee: the third of bookes
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:14153:132"/> that had beene in vſe for two hundred yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> The reuocation therefore and inhibition is onely of bookes publiſhed in the vulgar tongue, whoſe firſt inſtitution was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the apoſtolike ſea, and which had not beene vſed aboue two hundred yeares.</p>
               <p>9 Now the bookes out of which I haue gathered the former ſtuffe, are not within the compaſſe of the ſaide inhibition, but doe ſtill remaine in force by the former exceptions. For although the titles and pardons prefixed to the praiers in them contained be in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tongue, yet the praiers themſelues and the other ſubiect matter of the ſaide booke is all in latin. Againe their firſt inſtitution was allowed by the Apoſtolike ſee: otherwiſe they would neuer haue had ſuch publike vſe and ſufferance, eſpecially in Cathedrall churches as they had. Laſtly although ſome few prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (as one in king Henrie, and an other the pardon whereof was graunted at the inſtance of Queene Elizabeth wife to king Henrie the ſeauenth, and a fewe more perhaps (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſay ſome ſuch praiers of late edition, are here and there inſerted, yet as touching the principall ſubſtance of the bookes, that they haue beene in vſe, farre aboue two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares, it may euidently appeare to them that will compare the diuers bookes of diuers impreſſions together. Wherefore as I haue heard that ſome great men in their laſt will and teſtament, haue ſometime made a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:14153:132"/> gift vnto their wife of all their houſhold ſtuff, all their plate, all their golden chaines and bracelets, all their rings and iewels whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and yet afterward haue excepted ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the former things, and giuen them to their other friends, that their former gift to to their wife, hath not come to any great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, notwithſtanding all the former great words: euen ſo, although the foreſaide pope Pius the filt, ſee me at the firſt to make a large Inhibition, yet the exceptions following make the former inhibition in a manner no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth: becauſe there were ſcarſe any former ſeruice bookes, which might not chalenge their former vſe and allowance, by ſome of thoſe exceptions. Now further al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the ſame new booke aboue menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, Pius quintus doe alſo admoniſh all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:14153:135"/> acount both the man and the worke is with the popiſh church.</p>
               <p>4 In the worke it ſelfe there are firſt of all nine ſermons for the immaculate concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the virgin Marie, that is, to prooue her conception without ſinne. All theſe are ſo impious and blaſphemous, that I cannot tell what ſpeciall thing almoſt to note, except I ſhould ſet downe the whole ſermons. The cheefe matter it ſelfe of theſe ſermons beeing ſo iniurious vnto Chriſt Ieſus, and ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to all the ſcriptures, which with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condemne all fleſh of ſinne (Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe onely excepted) how can the ſermons themſelues be free from impietie? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding euen of theſe firſt nine ſermons I will giue the reader a taſt, that thereby he may diſcerne the great diuinitie, and other learning, both of the foreſaid author, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the popiſh church which ſo allowed of them.

Is not this learnedly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? Nay what boie ſeeth not how doltiſh and blockiſh an argument he maketh? For firſt of all, Chriſt was not the ſonne of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Marie till he was conceiued and borne of her: therefore neither was he bound to performe any dutie vnto her till that time. Secondly Chriſt was not the ſonne of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, as he was God, but as he was a man, and the mediatour betwixt God and man. As he had no father according to the fleſh, ſo he had no mother according to the Godhead. Againe by the ſame argument he might haue concluded, that Chriſt ſhould alſo haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred her to the vttermoſt of his power in earthly things: for this is alſo the dutie of children as well as to keepe their parents from euils. Laſtly ſo alſo he might haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the virgins mother and other friends to be conceiued without ſinne. For children are not onely bound to their next parents, but alſo to their forefathers, and other kindred to keepe them from all euills, &amp; to helpe them touching all good things what lieth in them
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:14153:136"/> to doe, and ſo in the end it would follow that no fleſh is conceiued in ſinne. For by progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we ſhould come at length to the firſt parents not of the virgin onely, but alſo of all mankinde, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5 The ſecond ſermon beeing made of theſe words, pſal. 87. 1. <hi>fundamenta eius in montibus ſanctis,</hi> her foundations are in the holy mountaines, and this ſcripture ſpoken of the Church generally beeing applied vnto, and choſen to ſpeake particularly of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Marie: this ſecond ſermon (I ſay) is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the very ſame three parts that we haue heard of the former.

               <p>6 The third ſermon is vpon a text out of the Macchabees. This ſermon he alſo diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as the former: but ſtill he ſhe weth his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, as though he had a well of words in his head. For thus he ſetteth them downe: <note place="margin">The yong ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler may doe well to note the great varietie of Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour.

Then vpon thoſe premiſes he concludeth the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his ſeruice, made for the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate conception of the virgin, &amp;c. whereof
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14153:137"/> I will alſo giue the reader a taſt after that I haue deliuered him the taſt of theſe nine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
               <p>7 The fourth ſermon hath the three parts of the former ſermons, but ſet downe with new words <hi>(it a inexhauſta erat huius doctoris eloquentia)</hi> thus: 1. <hi>dicitur impugnationis. 2. defenſionis. 3. corroborationis.</hi> In the firſt of theſe he maketh this obiection againſt the immaculate conception of the virgine. <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis homo qui per concubitum viri &amp; mulieris natus eſt, eſt in peccatis conceptus.</hi> Euery man that is borne by the copulation of a man and a woman is conceiued in ſinne. This he proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth as by the teſtimonie of Auguſtine in the firſt place, ſo alſo in the ſecond place, by the teſtimonie of our Sauiour Chriſt, Math. 7. eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but an euill tree bringeth forth euill fruit. Then he addeth, that foraſmuch as the parents of the virgin were euill, therefore it muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that ſhee was conceiued in ſinne. How doth he anſwer the former argument in the ſecond part of the ſermon, which he calleth <hi>defenſionis?</hi> Alas poore ſignie, he is ſo troubled with it that he cannot tell what in the world with reaſon to ſaie to it. For firſt he ſaith that God that gaue that law, that all that were borne of ſinnefull parents ſhould be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in ſinne, might cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:14153:137"/> then he addeth that the former teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Auguſtine applied to confirmation of the former argument, is to be vnderſtood with this caution, <hi>nulla ſpecial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie he onely affirmeth without any proofe at all, yea without any one word more. Then he addeth an other anſwer to the teſtimonie of Auguſtine, as fearing the former not to be ſufficient. <hi>vel dicere poſſumus quod Auguſtinus loquitur, de his qui concipiuntur interueniente concupiſcentia parentum, quali modo non fuit concepta mater dei:</hi> that is, or elſe we may ſay that Auguſtine ſpeaketh of thoſe which are conceiued with the concupiſcence of their parents, in which manner the mother of God was not conceiued. How alſo doth he prooue this? forſooth he referreth vs to the ſecond part of the worke, and the firſt ſermon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and third part of the firſt ſermon. And what haue we there? verily nothing but a long tale out of the Legend of the virgin Marie, to this effect. That her parents loachim and Anna hauing liued for the ſpace of xx. yeares without iſſue, did at the laſt vow that if God <note place="margin">A pretie tale of the manner of the virgins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</note> would giue them iſſue, it ſhould be the Lords. Afterward according to their yearely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, comming to the feaſt of the dedication of the temple, Ioachim offered his offering. But the prieſt reiected it, and rebuked him
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:14153:138"/> for preſuming to come to the altar, beeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Ioachim beeing put to this ſhame, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned not home but went a ſide to his ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, where hauing ſtaied a while, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord appeared vnto him and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him, telling him that the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach was not well obiected againſt him, becauſe God was a reuenger of ſinne, not of nature: and that when the wombe of any is ſhut, God doth it that he might open it the more miraculouſly, and that that which is ſo borne, might be knowne to be <hi>divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In fine the angel telleth him that his wife ſhould haue a daughter, which ſhould be called Marie, and that ſhee ſhould be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified from the wombe, and that according to their vowe ſhee ſhould be the Lords, not liuing abroad with other men and women, but keeping alwaies in the temple, and that ſhee ſhould alſo bring forth a ſonne which ſhould be called Ieſus, and which ſhould be ſaluation to his people, &amp;c. This is the ſumme of that matter whereunto he doth referre vs. Now what proofe is this of that whereunto it is applied? Firſt of all, this is taken but our of the Legend of lies: and if it had beene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:14153:138"/> farre leſſe importance? Againe though it ſhould be graunted for a truth, yet it maketh no more for the conception of the virgin, without luſt of her parents, and without ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne, then for the like conception of Iſaac, of all the children of Rahel, of Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and of Samuel. And by the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might all thoſe be prooued to haue bin conceiued without originall ſinne, as well as the virgin Marie. Laſtly if this tale were truth, then either the parents of the vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For the ſcripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no ſuch thing, yea it teacheth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, namely that Marie liued not in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple continually at Ieruſalem, according to the former word of the angel, and vow of her parents, but at Nazareth in Galile, many miles diſtant from Ieruſalem, Againe if there had beene any ſuch vow of the parents of the virgin, or any ſuch reuelation of the angel, would the virgin haue betroathed her ſelfe vnto an husband? or could ſhee ſo doe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out actuall ſinne. And if the angel had before told her parents, that ſhee ſhould be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the holy Ghoſt, and bring forth a ſonne, whome ſhee ſhould call Ieſus, would ſhee haue ſo wondered at the ſecond decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof by the angel Gabriel to her ſelfe as ſhee did? Luk. 1. 3. would ſhee haue ſaide, <hi>how ſhall this be ſeeing I know not a man?</hi> Thus much for the learning of the great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14153:139"/> in his fourth ſermon of the immaculate conception of the virgin.</p>
               <p>8 For his fift ſermon, he ſeemeth to take foure texts: 1. certaine wordes of Anſelmus, <hi>Candor eſt lucis eterne, &amp;c.</hi> 2. certaine wordes <note place="margin">Foure texts for one ſermon.</note> of Ambroſe, <hi>quid nobilius dei matre, &amp;c.</hi> 3. cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wordes of Eccleſiaſticus, chap. 44. <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritudinem candoris eius admirabitur oculus.</hi> 4. certaine wordes of Salomon (but I cannot tell where) <hi>Candor eſt, &amp;c.</hi> then proceedeth to the parts of his ſermon, ſaying, <hi>Super quibus verbatres conſiderationes faciemus. primadici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur oſtenſionis. 2. teſtificationis. 3. appellabitur figurationis.</hi> Are not theſe parts (O ye learned readers) learnedly ſet downe? and may not the learne deſt of you all, learne ſome what by this old learning? yea but marke as great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alſo in the handling of euery one of theſe parts. For he telleth vs touching the firſt part, that the conception of the virgin without ſinne, may be prooued by 14. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. O wonderfull; had not a iuſt doſen beene ſufficient, eſpecially with one odde ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to haue bound vp the reſt together? But what are theſe 14. arguments? they are thus ſet downe. 1. <hi>dicetur appellationis. 2. equationis. 3. conceſſionis. 4. filiationis. 5. ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationis. 6. verificationis. 7. veriſimulationis. 8. approbationis. 9. preſumptionis. 10. nobililati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis. 11. ſubiectionis. 12. parturitionis. 13. libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationis. 14. ſuperationis.</hi> Sutable alſo to theſe tearmes of arguments, is the matter it ſelfe.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14153:139"/> For to omit other things, thus he expoundeth and handleth the ſeauenth argument. <hi>Sexta</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>dicitur verificationis. vt enim veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficentur, verba que dicuntur, in miſſa beate vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis &amp; habentur proverb. 8. neceſſe eſt dicere illam ſine originali peccato conceptam.

For that the wordes may be verified, which are ſaid in the maſſe of the virgin, and are alſo in the 8. of the Proverbs, we muſt of neceſſitie ſay, that ſhee was conceiued without origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne. For there it is ſaide in her perſon, <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his waies,</hi> which were not true, if the bleſſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin had beene poſſeſſed of a deuill through ſinne in her conception. For nothing can be kept in perfect gouernment by two lords. Who ſeeth not how fooliſhly and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly he applieth that to the virgin Marie which is ſpoken of wiſdome? Might he not haue eaſed himſelfe of much labour about the immaculate conception of the virgin, and by the ſame argument haue as well prooued her not to haue beene conceiued at all, but to haue beene eternall? it cannot be denied. For in that place Salomon ſpeaketh of the eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of wiſdome, by wiſdome alſo vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14153:140"/> Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, the wiſdome of his father.

The like learning the ſame ſeraphicall clarke ſheweth in the third part of that ſermon, where he prooueth the immaculate conception of the virgin by 12. figures. The firſt whereof he maketh the firſt woman in the firſt creation, Gen. 3. <hi>inimiciti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ponam inter te &amp; mulierem &amp; ſemen tuum &amp; ſemen illius &amp; ipſa conteret caput tuum.</hi> I will put enmitie betweene thee and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and betweene thy ſeede and her ſeede, ſhee ſhall bruiſe thy head, &amp;c.

               <p>8 For the fourth leſſon of the third day of her conception, they read this: <hi>Legitur in quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam beati dominici opuſculo, quod cum regularis eſſet canonicus, &amp;c.</hi> that is, It is read in a certain work of bleſſed Dominick that when he was a regular Canon in the Biſhoprick of Tholoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, he diſputed with certaine heretiks, which affirmed many concluſions contrary to truth. Now amongſt other opinions they preached
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:14153:145"/> this vnto the people, namely that the virgin was not preſerued from original ſinne. When bleſſed Dominicke ſaw that he could not perſwade them the truth, he tooke this order with them; that both ſides ſhould put their concluſions together in a burning ouen, and <note place="margin">Taliter cum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>5 In this third ſermon of the nomination of Marie, in the ende of the fourth excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of her name, thus he writeth. <hi>Quarto</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>licet ad ipſam appellare, ſi quis a dei iuſtitia ſe grauari ſentit, &amp;c.</hi> that is, Fourthly it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

               <p>6 In the fourth part of the booke, and ninth ſermon of the graces of Marie, he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that ſhee was able to heale diſeaſes onely by her word leafe 143. and anon after, <note place="margin">Marie able to heale diſeaſes by her word onely.

               </p>
               <p>7 In the firſt part of the 6. ſermon of the Annunciation of the virgin (which is long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the former) which part he calleth <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minabilitatis,</hi> in this part, I ſay, he telleth ſuch a tale, as would make an horſe (as we ſpeake) breake his bridle to heare it.

Then was there great ſilence in heauen for halfe an houre, that they might the better deliberate what to ſay. The halfe houre beeing ended, euery order of Angels ſpake largely their minde for the fathers in Limbo. Then God hauing heard all their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, gaue ſentence, approouing the counſaile of the angels, and reiecting the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the deuill. Therefore he anſwered the ambaſſadours of the fathers very grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, telling them that he ſhortly in mercie
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:14153:151"/> would thinke vpon them. The ambaſſadours hearing this were filled with ioy, as it is ſaide of the Iewes, Heſt. 8. Then the three perſons of the Trinitie conſulted togither, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the ſending of Gabriel to the virgin Marie, &amp;c. This briefly is the ſumme of the tale which that great doctour Bernardine doth handle farre more largely, writing ſo largely thereof, as beeing written againe in latine without any abbreuiations, would fill two ſheetes of paper. And was it not paines thinke you well taken? yes, yes, without all doubt. For ſo we ſee more touching the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the angel Gabriel to the virgin, then is contained in all the Scripture, or then agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with any truth.

               <p>9 In the ſecond ſermon of the viſitation of Marie, leafe 234. at the letter V, thus he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to the virgin Marie: <hi>Profecto ſi fas eſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, tu ſecundum quid maiora feciſti deo, &amp;c.</hi> that is, Truly if I may be ſo bold as to ſpeake, thou in ſome reſpect haſt done greater things <note place="margin">The virgin hath done more for God, then God for her and all mankinde.</note> for God, then God himſelfe hath done for thee, or for all mankinde.

For thou diddeſt onely ſing. <hi>He that is mightie hath done great things vnto me:</hi> but I ſing and ſay, that thou haſt done greater things to him that is mightie. For God formed man of the clay of the earth, but thou moſt bleſſed virgin haſt brought forth God of thy moſt pretious blood, and haſt couered and cloathed him with thy moſt pure fleſhe ſo that thou maiſt ſay that of Eccleſiaſticus, chap. 24. <hi>I haue cauſed light to riſe in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens that will neuer goe out, and haue couered all fleſh as it were with a cloud,</hi> and thy moſt pure fleſh excelleth all things in the world. Againe God brought vp man with the fruits of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, but thou haſt nouriſhed God himſelfe with thy breaſts full of heauen, of which milke one droppe is of more value, then all the trees in paradiſe, or then all the fruits of the whole world. God alſo hath cloathed man with a garment of skinnes, but thou glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious virgin haſt wrapped the ſonne of God
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:14153:152"/> in thy cloutes, and afterward diddeſt put vpon him a ſeameleſſe garment, which is farre more better then all the coates in the world.</p>
               <p>10 In his ſecond ſermon, <hi>de festo nivis,</hi> leafe 290. after the letter N, thus he writeth: <hi>Cum beata virgo ſit mater dei, &amp;c.</hi> that is, Sith the bleſſed Virgin is the mother of God, and God her ſonne; and euery ſonne naturally is inferiour to the mother and her ſubiect, and the mother preferred vnto and aboue the ſonne: it followeth that the bleſſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <note place="margin">God inferiour to the virgin.</note> is aboue God, and that God is her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect in regard of the humanitie taken from her. In the ſame ſermon the beginning of the 292. leafe thus he writeth, <hi>Legitur quod predicantibus Apostolis, &amp;c.</hi> that is, We reade that the Apoſtles preaching but not beeing able to conuert ſome, they ſent them to the bleſſed virgine who admiring the beautie of the mother of God and her moſt wiſe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, were conuerted to the faith. In the ſame ſermon leafe 294. a little before the letter I, hauing compared, Marie to a ladder, and called her the ladder of heauen, he bringeth in Bernard ſpeaking thus to the Virgin, <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>11 In his ſecond ſermon of the 9. part of the booke with this title, <hi>Maria terra,</hi> leafe 303. at the letter R, thus he writeth, <hi>Si quis querat quareoum diabolus tempore Tobie 7 vii ros Sare ſtrangulauerit, &amp;c.</hi> that is, If any man <note place="margin">The word eum is ſuperſtuous, or els ſhould be cum.</note> aske why the deuill in the Time of Tobia did ſtrangle the ſeauen husbands of Sara for their ſinne, as it is Tob. 2. and yet now doth not kill all whome mortall ſinnes doe giue into his hands: I anſwer, that this proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

We have heard the fame of his power, and wonderfull is his power.</hi> All theſe things that I ſay, and many other the like, partly blaſphemouſly and partly fooliſhly he applieth to the virgin Marie.

The firſt day is the knowledge of ſinnes: the ſecond the contrition of the heart: the third the confeſſion of the mouth: the fourth the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life: the fifth the remitting of iniuries: the ſixth the reſtoring of debts: the ſeauenth the repairing of credit: the eight the receiuing of the euchariſt or communion. Is not this a ſubtile, a lightſome, and an acute or wittie, and ſharpe manner of interpreting the ſcriptures, according to the titles before gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to this Vincent? and was he not well worthie to be ſainted for ſuch interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? but let vs ſee further.</p>
               <p>5 His fifth ſermon for the ſame day is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe words, <hi>Noli eſſe incredulus ſed fidelis.</hi> Be not faithles but beleeue, Ioh. 20.

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:14153:158"/> naturae, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe in the law of nature that explicite faith was ſufficient, which might be <note place="margin">What faith Saint Vincent maketh alwaies neceſſary to ſaluation.</note> had in the naturall vnderſtanding with out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bookes, namely to beleeue, firſt that there was one God, which may be knowne by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vnderſtanding, as the power of a lord is knowne by the building of a great houſe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he is a iuſt god &amp; a rewarder, &amp;c. Then for the time of the law of Moſes, he ſaith that it was neceſſarie to beleeue three articles of faith, namely the former two, and for the third, that God would ſend his ſonne to be a ſauiour of the world. And he addeth, <hi>Alia ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creta fidei non tenebantur ſcire, niſi magni lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rati.</hi> The other ſecrets of faith none were bound to know, but onely the great learned men. Laſtly now in the time of the law of grace, he ſaith that men muſt beleeue the 12. articles of faith, &amp;c. Who ſeeth not but that by this doctrine, before the law of Moſes a man might be ſaued, firſt onely by naturall vnderſtanding without any other grace, yea without the helpe of any booke: ſecondly without any faith at all in Chriſt euen to come. And then what needed the Lord, Gen. 3. 15. and often elſwhere before the lawe of Moſes to haue made any promiſe of Chriſt Ieſus? yea how is it ſaid that <hi>Abraham belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and it was accounted vnto him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes?</hi> yea that <hi>Abraham did ſee the daie of Chriſt and reioyced?</hi>

Here let the reader note, how wittily this great Saint Doctour maketh the whole bodie of Chriſt a part of his bodie.</p>
               <p>7 To paſſe by many other things, for his firſt ſermon of the bodie of Chriſt, leafe 97. he taketh this text, <hi>Ego accepi a domino quod &amp; tradidi vobis.</hi> I haue receiued of the Lord that which I haue deliuered vnto you. Then he ſheweth his auditors where he had this text, <hi>verbum iſtud habetur textualiter,</hi> 1. Cor. 11. &amp;c. In the beginning of this ſermon he hath ſome pretie things indeede worth the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, as that he ſaith, that the heart of man is not to enlarge it ſelfe to beleeue more, nor the mouth to ſpeake, <hi>niſi quantum habemus ex ſacra ſcriptura,</hi> but as much as we haue out of the holy ſcripture. And againe, <hi>The holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the mouth of god, hauing two lippes, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the two teſtaments: the upper lippe is the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; &amp; the nether the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he returneth to his old faſhion, &amp; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> learning of thoſe times, adding, <hi>Inter cetera mirabilia &amp; ſecreta huius ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:14153:159"/> 4. perreptio ſenſualis. 5. receptio vſuoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi> that is, Amongſt other miracles and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of this ſacrament, fiue are principall, &amp;c. The 1. is a ſubſtantiall chaunge, the 2. the prieſtly operation, the 3. a ſacramentall dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the 4. a ſenſible perceiuing, the 5. an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall receiuing. In handling the ſecond of theſe, and magnifying the operation of the prieſt, by the place from whence he fetcheth Chriſt into the ſacrament; he ſetteth downe firſt diuers places from whence Chriſt is not drawne into the ſacrament, namely, nor out of the aire, nor out of the ſphere of the fire, nor out of the heauen of the moone, nor out of the heauen of Mercurie, nor out of the heauen of Venus, nor out of the heauen of the ſunne, nor out of the heauen of Mars, nor out of the heauen of the ſtarres (O wonderfull elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:) at laſt he ſheweth that he fetcheth him out of the higheſt heauen. Then he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his rhetoricall acclamation, <hi>Ecce opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ſacerdotalis:</hi> behold the prieſtly operation or working. Then followeth this goodly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude. <hi>Sicut quod quando virgo, &amp;c.</hi> For as when the virgin Marie beeing ſaluted by the angel Gabriel, did giue her conſent and ſaid, <hi>Behold the handmaid of the Lord,</hi> Luk. 1. at the laſt word heauen was opened, and the ſonne of God deſcended into her wombe, and the angel and the virgin did worſhip him in the wombe, and as the mouth of the virgin ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned heauen: ſo doth the mouth of the prieſt,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:14153:159"/> and that in a more excellent manner, (it ſhall not offend the virgin Marie if I ſpeake the <note place="margin">The prieſts work in the maſſe, greater then the virgins in concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Chriſt. <hi>Habuit dicere octo verba.</hi> Neither the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin nor Chriſt ſpake any latin.</note> truth) becauſe the virgin to open heauen had to ſay eight wordes, the 1. <hi>Behold,</hi> the 2. <hi>the handmaid, &amp;c.</hi> till ſhee had ſaide all, for then was heauen opened and ſhee conceiued: but the Prieſt ſpeaketh fiue words onely, and when he ſpeaketh the laſt word. to wit, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> then is heauen opened, and Chriſt is in the hoſt. Againe the virgin Marie did open hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen but once: but the prieſt euery day and in euery maſſe. Againe he deſcended into the virgins wombe but little, not ſo bigge as an ante, and paſſible alſo and mortall: but into the hoſt he deſcendeth as great as he is in heauen, and as he was vpon the croſſe, neither paſſible nor mortall, but glorious and impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>8 Neare vnto the beginning of the next ſermon, leafe 99. thus he writeth, <hi>Sicut Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus fuit eleuatus &amp; crucifixus inter, &amp;c.</hi> As Chriſt was lifted vp and crucified betweene two theeues: ſo the hoſt beeing conſecrated is lifted vp by two hands, the right and the left, which ſignifie the theeues. And as then the bodie of Chriſt was white by ſhedding <note place="margin">A fitte and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſmiliuda</note> forth blood: ſo the hoſt is lifted vp white. The former of theſe ſimilitudes is very apt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if in the application thereof, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the interpretation thereof of the two hands of the prieſt, he had ſaid <hi>which are,</hi> and not <hi>which ſignifie.</hi> For they are indeede two
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:14153:160"/> theeues robbing God of his glorie, and men of many a penie.</p>
               <p>9 In the beginning of the fourth ſermon of the bodie of Chriſt, he ſheweth how the maſſe is remembrance of Chriſts death. This he ſheweth thus: <hi>Altare ſignificat crucem, &amp;c.</hi> The altar ſignifieth the croſſe: the reaſon is, <note place="margin">How the Maſſe is a remembrance of Chriſts death.</note> becauſe on the altar the bodie and blood of Chriſt are ſacramentally conſecrated: ſo vpon the croſſe he was really ſacrificed. The cuppe or chalice ſignifieth the ſepulchre of Chriſt; becauſe as in the chalice the bodie and blood of Chriſt is contained: ſo in the ſepulchre the bodie of Chriſt was really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. By the couer is vnderſtood the ſtone which was laide vpon the dore of the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre to couer it: ſo is the couer to the chalice. By the corporall wherein the bodie of Chriſt is put, are vnderſtood the linnen cloathes in which the bodie of Chriſt was wrapped. Is not this trimme ſtuffe? what word is there in the ſcripture of an altar at the firſt inſtitution of the ſupper? Againe here is no mention at all of the hoſt: neither is the hoſt put into the chalice, as the bodie of Chriſt was laide in the graue. How alſo will they prooue that the cuppe that our Sauiour bleſſed at the firſt inſtitution of the ſupper, had a couer? Laſtly the linnen cloathes wherof they ſpeake, were not vſed in the firſt ſupper, neither at the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Chriſt, but after his death, for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of the bodie, when the ſoule was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:14153:160"/> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: neither was the body of Chriſt wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in linnen clothes by the Apoſtles whoſe ſucceſſours they boaſt them ſelues to be, but by Ioſeph of Arimathea and Nicodemus.</p>

               </p>
               <p>18 In his fourth ſermon for the 9.

               <p>19 In the next ſermon but one he ſaith, that as in an apple there are certaine houſes wherein are the kernells: ſo in the foure parts of the earth there are foure chambers. <hi>Prima</hi>

Where finde they this diuinitie in the Scripture?</p>
               <p>20 In the ſecond ſermon for the 11.

A. <hi>Prima eſt ſtabilit as in gratia. 2. eſt ſecurit as de gloria. 3. acerbitas de pena. 4. paupert as nimia.</hi> The firſt is ſtabilitie in grace, the ſecond is ſecuritie or certentie of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:14153:163"/> glorie, the third ſharpnes of puniſhment, the fourth extreame pouertie. By the two firſt of <note place="margin">All in purgatorie, are beggers.</note> theſe, that is manifeſt that in my former trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe I haue ſaide in the ſeauenth argument thereof, namely that in peoperie there is no ſound ioy and comfort.

               <p>21 HIs text of his firſt ſermon for the 14. Lords daie, leafe 189. is this, <hi>Are there not tenne clenſied?</hi> Luk. 17.

               <p>22 In the next ſermon, that text beeing <hi>Goe ſhew your ſelues to the prieſts,</hi> after the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof, thus he writeth For loue of this word, I haue ſought in the ſcripture, as well in the old as in the new teſtament, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies God hath obſerued for healing the leproſie: and I finde he hath cured it 5. waies.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:14153:164"/> 
                  <hi>Primo per ablutionem corporalem,</hi> by bodily waſhing. 2. <hi>per tactum manualem,</hi> by touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Fiue waies of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the leproſie.</note> with the hand. 3. <hi>per oſtenſionem viſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> by viſible ſhewing. 4. <hi>per abſconſionem ſinualem,</hi> by boſome hiding. 5. <hi>per ſeparatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem perſonalem,</hi> by perſonall ſeparation. The third of theſe he ſaith that his text ſpeaketh of. Vnto the fifth he applieth the wordes of God vnto Moſes touching Miriam, after that he had ſtricken her with the leproſie, <hi>Let her be ſhut out of the hoſt ſeauen daies,</hi> Numb. 12. where, vpon the words <hi>ſeaven daies,</hi> he noteth that by them are vnderſtood ſeauen things, wherein ſtandeth perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of religion.

Will not any man thinke all this to be profound diuinitie?</p>
               <p>23 In his fourth ſermon for the 16. Lords daie after Trinitie, leafe 209. A. he hath theſe wordes, <hi>Tranſeuntes primam &amp; ſecundam cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodiam, &amp;c.</hi> When they had paſſed the firſt <note place="margin">Act 12. 10.</note> and ſecond watch, they came to the yron gate, that is, to purgatorie, becauſe as yron is harder and wood; ſo the paines of purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is harder then yron, and the paine of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie exceedeth the paine of this world.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:14153:164"/> But there is comfort for them, that this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging time beeing finiſhed, they enter into the citie of paradiſe. Wherefore it followeth in the foreſaid authoritie, <hi>which opened vnto them by it owne accord.</hi> Is not this as profound diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie as the former? what compariſon is there betwixt the iron gate where by S. Peter had no paine, and purgatorie, of the paines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">S. Peter in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.</note> the Papiſts doe ſo often complaine? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine if the iron gate were purgatorie, then Peter went through purgatorie. Will the Popes beare this that Peter whoſe ſucceſſors they all boaſt themſelues to be, ſhould paſſe through the fire of purgatorie? Againe how doth this ſimilitude agree with it ſelfe? for Peter had firſt beene in priſon, and beeing releaſed out of priſon, he came vnto, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the iron gate, whence it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Peter had beene in the hardeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition before he came to the iron gate: but this great and learned Doctour telleth vs the contrarie, namely that the paines of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie are greater and harder then all former paines. Laſtly this iron gate was hard by the citie, whereby he vnderſtandeth para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe or heauen: but purgatorie is as farre diſtant from heauen as the earth, yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what further then the vpper part of the earth, becauſe by their doctrine it is within the earth.</p>
               <p>23 In the 2. ſermon for the 19. Lords day he hath this ſweete latin, the engliſh where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

               </p>
               <p>24 The like latine is in the firſt ſermon for the next daie, where he ſetteth downe <hi>haec tria puncta multum notabilia. Primus eſt humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas diuinalis. Secundus eſt peruerſitas huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis. Tertius eſt indignitas meritalis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>25 The text of his third ſermon for the 22. Lords daie is this, <hi>Patientiam habe in me, &amp;c.</hi> Haue patience towards me, and I will pay thee all, Math. 16. In the ende of this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thus he writeth, <hi>Sciatis quod modo pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimus, &amp;c.</hi> that is, Vnderſtand that if we can paie him with ten works he will be content; which is ſignified in this word <hi>patientia,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are ten letters: becauſe as we haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt the ten commandements, ſo we muſt ſatisfie with ten penitentiall workes. Here to omit the diuinitie of the doctour in this place, let the reader obſerue how foully he was deceiued in Arithmetike, euen in nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration. <note place="margin">S.

If any ſhall anſwer that he meant the accuſatiue caſe <hi>patientiam,</hi> as it is in the

               <p>26 Thus much ſhall ſuffice for a taſt of ſuch ſoure liquour as is in S. Vincents veſſell; yea let this ſuffice for a taſt of all the reſt. Such as we haue ſeene theſe two Doctours to be, ſuch for the moſt part are the other popiſh writers of that age, and of theſe times of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie. I had indeede thought to haue giuen the like taſt of ſome other of their writings, but becauſe I thinke this alreadie giuen to be ſufficient (if not more then ſufficient, except the matter were ſweeter and pleaſanter) I will therefore here ſpare the further paines of my ſelfe and of the reader.</p>
               <p>27 Theſe thinges I haue thought good thus to write, for the auoiding of all aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt me by any actions of ſlaunder, for obiecting ſo much ignorance (beſides the blaſphemies) to thoſe times wherein poperie did weare the garland. If I had not thus laide downe their owne wordes, it may be many would haue thought, that there had not bin ſo high blaſphemies, neither ſo foule and groſſe abſurdities with ſuch rudenes and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſme, as by theſe few things I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

               <p>28 By theſe blaſphemies thus diſcouered, farre beyond the opinion (I thinke) of all that vnderſtand not the latin tongue, &amp; that haue not bin acquainted with theſe deepe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the iniquitie of poperie, I wiſh all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that as now they ſee poperie to be more blaſphemous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer they had thought it to haue beene: ſo For euer here after they hate all poperie both the head and the taile, both the ſubſtance and all the accidents, with a more perfect hatred then they haue done.</p>
               <p>29 And becauſe I doe verily thinke, that many papiſts themſelues did neuer imagine ſo high abominations to be contained in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, as hauing beene learned to beleeue as the Church beleeueth, that <hi>ignorance is the mother of deuotion,</hi> and ſuch other like princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and hauing not therefore euer truly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the ſubſtance of poperie: I doe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo againe earneſtly exhort them, as they loue Gods glorie, which now they ſee alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impaired &amp; diſgraced by poperie ſo for the time to come, they loath this religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as much as euer ignorantly they haue loued it: and that they thinke it as beaſtly, as filthie, and abominable, as euer hitherto, they beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued haue eſteemed it reaſonable, amiable, and acceptable in the ſight of God.</p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:14153:166"/>
               <p>30 All ſuch as loue learning, let them in like manner abhorre this Romiſh religion. For although now all kinde of learning doe flouriſh by the meanes of the goſpel: yet if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer poperie preuaile as it hath done, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the former ſtrength (as I hope it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doe) doubtles all learning will wither and decaie againe. In the time of the Apoſtles, &amp; in the age of the primitiue church, the gifts of Gods ſpirit did much more abound then now they doe: yet as poperie ſpread it ſelfe ouer the face of the earth, ſo thoſe gifts decaied, vntill there was as much barbariſme, as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie. Let the like therefore be feared if po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie ſhould againe aſcend the ſtaires of her former dignitie.</p>
               <p>31 If any ſhall obiect againſt theſe things that I haue noted out of popiſh writings, for the diſgracing of poperie, that in many of our books like wiſe there are ſome vanities &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities: I anſwer that though this ſhould be <note place="margin">An anſwer to an obiection touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former popiſh teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> graunted, yet firſt the matters are not ſo blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, ſo groſſe, ſo rude, and ſo ridiculous, as theſe that I haue noted, &amp; a thouſand yea ten thouſand the like. Secondly the number of them is not ſo great. Thirdly the perſons that haue written ſuch vanities, are not of that credit in our whole church as theſe and other are with their Church. Fourthly our mens books are not publiſhed by ſuch high autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie &amp; ſolemne allowance, as the bookes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned and other the like writings of theirs haue bin.</p>

               <head>THE SEAVENTH PART.</head>
               <p>IT remaineth now, that according to my promiſe, I make the reader a litle banquet with ſome of the Virgins miracles. Herein I will be the briefer, by how much the larger I haue bin in the former. I will not therefore take all, neither the largeſt diſhes, leaſt I ſhould leaue her table bare: but I will onely make choice of the leaſt but yet the daintieſt iun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kats, that ſo the taking of them away may be the leſſe eſpied. Yet what neede I feare the miſſing of any thing from her table? her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is ſuch, that as they ſay of the croſſe vpon which Chriſt ſuffered, that whatſoeuer is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from it, yet it is not diminiſhed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth as ample as it was at the firſt: ſo we may like wiſe ſay of theſe her iunkats, that though we ſhould take neuerſo many of them, yet her table would be nothing the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. And therefore whereas the booke, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cloſet and ſtorehouſe of her mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (for ſo it is called, <hi>Promptuarium diſcipuli de miraculis beate Marie virginis)</hi> containeth but 99. miracles, this may well be added vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them for an other to make vp the whole hundred, that whatſoeuer a man taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yet her table remaineth as fully furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as at the firſt before any diſh was touched. And that no man may thinke theſe miracles to haue beene of meane account in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Church, let him firſt vnderſtand that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:14153:167"/> both they were ſolemnly read in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for leſſons in their publique ſeruice, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch feaſtiuall daies as they did obſerue vnto the virgin; as alſo the great diuines of the popiſh Church did commonly alleadge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their ſermons for authorities to prooue and confirme many of the points of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Both theſe things I haue made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. Againe, the gatherer together of theſe miracles, in his prologue to the whole worke, doth commend the dainties following to be <hi>Omni melle dulciora,</hi> ſweeter then any honie. What is this but to compare them with the written word of God, which is in like manner commended? pſal. 19. 10.</p>
               <p>2. Now for the manner of ſetting downe theſe miracles, I will for the more breuities ſake altogether omitthe latine (except now and then ſome ſpeciall word or phraſe which I will put in the margent) and content my ſelfe onely with the engliſh faithfully tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And in caſe the whole miracle be very long, I will onely ſet downe the ſumme ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of briefly. The contents of each example or miracle ſhall be placed in the margent. And all this I will doe ſo faithfully, that no Papiſt whatſoeuer ſhall be able iuſtly to charge me with any falſe dealing.</p>
               <p>3 To come then to the miracles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, I will paſſe by the firſt and ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and beginne with the third, the text whereof is this. There was a certaine woman

And ſhe teſtifying that by the interceſſion of the bleſſed virgin ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, ſaide vnto all them that flocked vnto the miracle, I beeing deliuered to the tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours was drawne to puniſhment: but the bleſſed virgin ſuccouring me ſaid, and asked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that did lead me, why they durſt preſume to lead her handmaid, and bad them quickly <note place="margin">

To whome the Lord ſaid, thou knoweſt mother, that without confeſſion ſhe cannot be ſaued: but becauſe I can denie nothing vnto thee, let her returne and confeſſe, and ſo ſhe ſhall be deliuered.

               <p>4 The next miracle is ſaid to be the third: but here the memorie of the author or of the printer failed. For the former was the third. And ſo by this meanes there is an errour in the number of the miracles following. For they are ſaid to be but ninetie nine, whereas indeede if they had beene numbered, they are a iuſt hundred, beſides that which before I ſpake of, namely, that take we away what
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:14153:169"/> of, namely, that take we away what we will of them, yet the number will be perfect. Now although this errour haue eſcaped the writer or the printer, yet I will follow the ſame, that if it ſhould pleaſe the reader to trie my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe by hauing recourſe to their owne booke, he might the ſooner finde that which he ſeeketh for. The ſumme of this twiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>third miracle is this.</p>
               <p>5 A certaine woman with a ſtraunge dreame, when ſhee did awake was depriued <note place="margin">The wife of a ſoldier hauing loſt her wits, is holpen by the virgin.</note> of her ſenſe, ſo that ſhee thought that the faith which before ſhee had, was betwixt her paps and did continually iſſue out. Her friends bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of heauines for this misfortune, tooke her and lead her through the place of the Saints, to trie if by any meanes they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer her. So they lodged in a Church of the holy Trinitie, but the holy Trinitie would not reſtore health, but reſerued the gift for the virgin, &amp;c. Then was holy water made adiured with many coniurings, but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">A woman the worſe beeing put into holy water.</note> put thereinto was the worſe and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then before. At length the yeare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming about, and the feaſt of the Purification of holy Marie approching, ſhee was brought to a certaine Church built in the honour of the virgin, and in faſhion farre vnlike other Churches, yet good enough for the Heremit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <note place="margin">Satis tamen congrua ad ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitandum he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitis.</note> to dwell in. Whilſt therefore ſhe lodged here at the foreſaid feaſt, ſhe was made as whole as if ſhe had neuer beene euill, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:14153:169"/>
               <p>6 The fourth example is of a certaine monke that beeing much ouercome of wine, <note place="margin">The virgin deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth a drunken Monke that had bin deuout vnto her.</note> and afterward recouering his ſenſes, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning home ward was met withall by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: firſt in the likenes of a great bull, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the likenes of a foule dogge, thirdly in the likenes of a cruell lyon. But alwaies a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine faire virgin with her haire hanging ouer <note place="margin">The Papiſts make the virgin a friend to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards.</note> her ſhoulders, beeing preſent chaſed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the laſt time tooke the monke by the hand and ſigned him with the croſſe in his forehead, and bad him goe to an other monke and confeſſe his ſinne, and doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he ſhould enioyne him, &amp;c. The fifth miracle is as followeth.</p>
               <p>7 There was a notorious and moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked theefe minding nothing but the ſeruice <note place="margin">A certaine theefe did faſt the vigils of Marie, and he could not die without the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> of the deuill: yet this good he had, that he did deuoutly faſt the vigils of bleſſed Marie with bread and water: and when he went about his theft, he ſaluted her with the deuotion that he could, deſiring her that ſhe would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to die in his mortall ſinne. Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beeing taken he was hanged, for three daies he hung and could not die. He called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to them that paſſed by that they ſhould bring him a prieſt. The prieſt comming with the Iudge and the people, he was taken from the gallowes, ſaying, that the bleſſed virgin had ſuſtained him. So he was ſet at libertie, and a while after he finiſhed his life lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie.</p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:14153:170"/>
               <p>8 To omit the 8. next miracles, the ſumme of the 14. is this. A certaine deuout woman <note place="margin">Marie deliuereth the ſonne of a certaine woman from captiuitie. <hi>Inconſolabiliter flebat.</hi>
                  </note> had a ſonne taken captiue in warre. Shee therefore wept moſt vncomfortably, and made many praiers for her ſonne to the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Marie. At length profiting nothing, ſhe ſaid vnto the virgin, O bleſſed virgin Marie, I haue often entreated thee for the deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of my ſonne; and thou haſt not heard me: therefore as my ſonne is taken from me, ſo <note place="margin">The woman cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth quit with the virgin.</note> will I take thy ſonne from thee, and I wil put him in cuſtodie as a pledge for my ſonne. Then taking the image of the childe out of <note place="margin">It was high time for the virgin to helpe this woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to her ſonne that ſhe might reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer her owne.</note> the lappe of Marie, ſhe went home, wrapped it in a cleane linnen cloath, and ſhut it dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently in her cheſt. And behold the night following bleſſed Marie appeared to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue young man and deliuered him. So vpon his returne, his mother reſtored the image of Ieſus to Marie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>9 The fifteenth is ſomewhat like the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in this manner. A certaine Matrone ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deuout to the virgin, had a little daughter which ſhee had put forth to nurſe (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) <note place="margin">Marie deliuereth a litle girle fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a woolfe.</note> in a village next by. It fell ſo out, that as this infant was playing in the ſtreete, a woolfe came and ranne away with it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could any man ſtay the woolfe or ſaue the childe. Newes of this beeing brought to the mother, as ſhee ſate at the table, ſhee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe and went into the chappell and tooke the image of our Sauiour out of the boſome
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:14153:170"/> of his mother, and with many teares brake forth into theſe wordes: Thou ſhalt neuer <note place="margin">Nunquom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habebis filium tuum, niſi mihi reſtituas filiam meam.</note> haue thy ſonne againe, except thou reſtore me my daughter. Vpon this the virgin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the woolfe, and preſently ſome following the woolfe recouered the childe, &amp;c. So the woman reſtored the virgins ſonne, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>10 The ſumme of the 16. example is this <note place="margin">Marie preſerueth a child from fire.</note> A certaine woman that daily ſaluted the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> one daie hauing none to ſend to the field with her husbands dinner, ſhe was conſtrained to goe her ſelfe. Hauing therefore a little ſonne, ſhe left him at home, and ſaluting the virgin with an <hi>Ave,</hi> ſhe committed him vnto her keeping. In her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, her houſe and all therein being burnt, at her returne with many teares ſhee expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulated the matter with the virgin. Then they ſought the childe, and found him alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without hurt.</p>
               <p>11 Here paſſing by the ſixe next, the 23. <note place="margin">Marie deliuereth an innocent wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from death.</note> is this. A certaine adulterer had an honeſt wife and much deuoted to the bleſſed virgin: but the miſerable adulterer did hate her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. By the inconſtancie of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhe came to ſuch want, that ſhe was conſtrained to nurſe the childe of a certaine ſoldier. The adulterer for enuie of his wife, came very ſecretly and cutte the childes throat, &amp; departed earely. When the woman awaked, and would haue giuen the child ſuck,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:14153:171"/> ſhe ſaw his throat cut. Then ſhe brake out into ſo great a crie, that all in the lodging did awake. But this was vnknowne to the father and all in the citie. The woman apprehended is brought vnto iudgement: and when ſhee was iudged to die, hauing no bodie to ſpeake for her, ſhee looking vp to heauen, ſaide, O Marie, thou knoweſt mine innocencie: to thee I commend my ſelfe. Theſe words en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <note place="margin">Metibi recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendo.</note> there came one ladie which did beare a faire boy, and with theſe wordes ſpake vnto all; Stay your ſelues, O Iudges: becauſe this <note place="margin">Suſtinete vos iudices.</note> boy ſhall be iudge this day. Then preſently the child ſaid vnto the iudge, So ought iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be of a murtherer; let the perſon mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered be brought, and let the anſwer of the woman be heard. All men maruailed at the wiſdome of this child, and preſently the child killed was brought. Then ſaid the childe in iudgement, Iudge tighteouſly, O ye ſonnes of men: and he ſaid to the childe murthered, In the name of the Lord ariſe, and name him that killed thee. Immediatly the childe that was killed aroſe, and hauing neuer ſpoke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then he beganne to ſpeake, and with his finger did ſhew the murtherer. So the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was diſmiſſed and the murtherer appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. In the meane time the ladie with her child vaniſhed away: and the adulterer beeing bound to an horſe taile moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly died.</p>
               <p>12 The ſumme of the 25. miracle is this.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:14153:171"/> In a certaine monaſterie of Nunnes, there was a very deuout virgin named Bettres, which for her deuotion beeing Wardneſſe, <note place="margin">Beatrix facta nutrix.</note> did diſcharge this office ſo much the more deuoutly, by how much the more freely ſhee did it. At length a certaine prieſt entiſing her to filthines, ſhee withſtood him a long time. But beeing in the ende ouercome, ſhee came to the altar of the bleſſed virgin which there was Patroneſſe, and reſigned her keyes, as not beeing able any longer to abide the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo ſhee ſecretly followed the prieſt. But within a little time he forſooke her, by which meanes ſhee came to great pouertie; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhamed to returne to her cloiſter, ſhee became a common whore: and hauing liued many yeares publikely in that ſinne, at length ſhe came vnto the gate of her Monaſterie in a ſecular habite, and asked the portreſſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe knew Bettres ſometime Wardneſſe of that Monaſterie. To whome the portreſſe anſwered that ſhee knewe her well, and that ſhee was a good ladie (or miſtreſſe) and holy, and that without rebuke ſhee had liued in <note place="margin">Domina proba.</note> that monaſterie from her infancie to that day. <note place="margin">

Shee beeing honeſt &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to her husband repelled him, whereby he was the more afflicted.

A certaine ſoldier a young man, much giuen to the world, had a deuout wife that praied often to the virgin Marie for his conuerſion.

And bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forſaken, the iudge asked; if there were none of the ſaints whom he had honoured at any time. The virgin Marie anſwered, that once in reuerence of her he had giuen a great waxe candle; ſo at her requeſt he was diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

               <p>16 Like vnto the former is the 51. the <note place="margin">The virgin a friend to encro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> ſumme and effect where of is this. A certaine ſecular man occupied in countrie buſines, as he was many waies euill; ſo in plowing of his ground he would encroch vpon his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and ſteale from them.

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:14153:174"/> was his ſoule deliuered from the power of his aduerſaries.</p>
               <p>17 The 53. example is of one that hauing learned of a virgin, that cuery one that faſted <note place="margin">How good a thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

The 54. is like vnto this.</p>
               <p>18 The 57. A certaine ſoldier did daily ſalute the bleſſed virgin Marie with an <hi>Aue</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">One ſaued onely by ſaluting daily the virgin Matir, without doing any other good thing.</note> 
                  <hi>Maria,</hi> when he aroſe in the morning, and at night when he laied him downe to ſleepe. He did no more good, and by the grace of the virgin he was ſaued. Like vnto which is the 45. example of a notable theefe that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had done any good thing, but onely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on ſaterday to the bleſſed ladie, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided her one maſſe, yet by the grace of the virgin he ſpake fiue wordes at his ende, by which he was ſaued. The like is also in the 60. example, of a certaine prieſt that was a notorious ſinner, and drowned as he went about his ſinne, or after he had committed it: and yet ſaluting the virgin he was ſaued. But this was mentioned before in the ſeruice of the virgin made by <hi>Bernardine de Busti.</hi> Laſtly, like vnto the former is the 72. exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is of a grieuous ſinner that neuer had done good, but onely ſaluted the virgin euery daie: and yet beeing dead, and chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged earneſtly by the deuills to be theirs, the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:14153:174"/> virgin Marie reſcued her, and ſaued her.</p>
               <p>19 The ſumme of the 78. example is this. <note place="margin">A prieſt deſireth to ſee the virgins beautie.</note> A certaine prieſt of Paris very deuout to the Virgin, entreated earneſtly to ſee her beautie. At le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth he was certified by an angel that his praiers was heard by the virgin, and that on ſuch a daie and houre ſhee would come vnto him, and he ſhould ſee her but withall that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he ſhould be blinde. The prieſt was glad of this ridings, and willingly accepted the condition. But after the departure of the angel, he began to thinke with himſelfe, that if he ſhould looſe both his eyes, he ſhould be vtterly vndone, a miſerable perſon, &amp; a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, as being vnfit for any thing. There fore he determined with himſelfe to behold her but <note place="margin">The prieſt coſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the virgin.</note> with one eye, and to ſhut his other eye, and that if he might keepe the ſight of one eye, that would be ſufficient. When the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed came the virgin appeared, and he put his hand before one of his eyes, and with the other did behold her, ſeeing ſo much of her beautie and glorie, as can be expreſſed with wordes, or thought in heart. So he loſt the <note place="margin">The beautie of the virgin.</note> ſight of one eye: not with ſtanding he was ſo rauiſhed with her beautie, that he greatly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented that he had not beheld her with both his eyes, and reprooued himſelfe for ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of one eye, wiſhing that he were wholly blinde, ſo as he might ſee her more fully. Wherefore he praied more earneſtly, that hee might ſee her the ſecond time. The
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:14153:175"/> angel therefore was ſent againe to certifie him of the ſecond comming of his ladie. The prieſt ſaid, that if he had a thouſand eyes, he could be content to looſe them all for euer, vpon condition that he might ſee her againe. Then the angel ſignified that he ſhould ſee her againe, and that he ſhould not onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy that eye which alreadie he had, but alſo haue the other eie reſtored. And ſo it came to paſſe: whereby we may conſider how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent the beautie of the virgin is, and how delectable a thing it is to beholde the ſame with our eyes.</p>
               <p>20 The 83. example. A certaine painter painted the deuill with hornes and other <note place="margin">Marie vpholdeth a painter from falling.</note> members as fouly as he could, to make him the more horrible: but he painted the image of the bleſſed virgin Marie, ſo comely and ſo faire as he could with diuers colours. The deuill therefore was very angrie with it, and enuied it: and in all haſt came to the painter, and queſtioned with him, ſaying, Why haſt thou made me ſo horrible and euill fauoured, and the bleſſed virgin Marie ſo faire and ſo comely? He anſwered, becauſe the thing was ſo in truth, as the picture made, ſhewed. The deuill being angrie, vpon a certain day would haue throwne the painter downe headlong from a loſt, where he painted the image of the bleſſed virgin Marie: and he brake the <note place="margin">confregit ligna in quibus ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</note> ſcaffold whereon the painter ſtood. But as the painter was falling, preſently the image of <note place="margin">vt caſum petijt.</note>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:14153:175"/> the moſt goodly virgin put forth her hand to the painter, and held him ſtrongly that he <note place="margin">If her image be ſo ſtrong, how ſtrong th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>21 The ſumme of the 84. miracle. In a certaine church built to the honour of S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael, in a mountaine called the tombe of Michael, there was the image of the virgin made of woode, with a vaile on her head in manner of a mitre. This church by lightning was once ſet on fire and burned. But when <note place="margin">The image of the father and the ſonne no doubt were in that Church: might not they alſo as well haue beene preſerued?</note> the fire came to the place where the virgins i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was, as though it feared the image, it did not ſo much as touch the ſame: yea the white vaile vpon her head had not ſo much as any ſauour of fire.</p>
               <p>22 The 93. in ſumme is this. A certaine ignorant prieſt that knew no maſſe but the <note place="margin">An ignorant prieſt ſuſpended by a biſhop.</note> ladies maſſe, beeing complained of to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, was by him ſuſpended from ſaying maſſe afterward.

The prieſt obiected that he was poore and a deſpiſed perſon, and that therefore he ſhould not be heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue any acceſſe to the Biſhop. Yet goe (ſaid the virgin) and I will make the way for thee. But, ſaide the prieſt, he will not beleeue my words. Shee anſwered, thou ſhalt tel him <note place="margin">The virgin too kinde to doe ſo much for a prieſt that had ſo litle faith.</note> for a token, that in ſuch an houre and in ſuch a place, as he was ſewing his ſackcloth, I held

In the morning therefore this prieſt went to the Biſhop with this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. The Biſhop hearing it maruailed, and admitted him againe to his place.

               <p>I Haue not gathered theſe, neither written any other thing of the deuotion of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts towards the virgin, to diſgrace her: farre be it from me, and from all other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: whome God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended as bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, him or her muſt no man diſgrace. Yea, as God hath pronounced her bleſſed aboue all other women, in regard that he honoured her with being mother to our Sauiour: ſo muſt all men yeeld her that prerogatiue. Not with ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as we muſt not denie her any thing that God hath granted her; ſo alſo muſt we take heede, that we be not more liberall vnto her, then God himſelfe hath beene. Eſpecially we muſt beware, that we make her not rich with the ſpoiles of God. And this is the great fault of the Papiſts, both towards the virgin &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo towards her ſaints, yea towards them that were neuer ſanctified: yea ſometime towards ſuch, as whom they can not prooue by good demonſtration, euer to haue bin in the world. All theſe they thinke that they neuer honour ſufficiently, till they take the crowne from Gods head, and from the head of his ſonne
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:14153:176"/> Chriſt Ieſus, &amp; ſet it vpon their head. And ſo, as they doe moſt extreame wrong to God &amp; to Chriſt Ieſus: ſo alſo they doe not honour, but highly diſhonour them, whom they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend moſt to honor. For what greater diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour can there be then mockerie? and what greater mockerie is there, then to giue to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon greater honour, then of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto him?</p>
               <p>2 As this is manifeſt of them by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, ſo eſpecially the ſame appeareth moſt euidently by theſe miracles which I haue here ſet downe, &amp; by many other part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained in that booke from whence I took theſe, &amp; partly diſperſed in other books, &amp; not comprehended in the former. For we haue ſeen how they make the virgin a patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of many notorious ſinnes &amp; impieties. We haue ſeene how they make her to make more account of one <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> and of one waxe candle offered vnto her, then of all duties belonging vnto God, in as much as ſhe hath ſaued them (as they ſay) that haue honoured her, though they had committed neuer ſo many, and neuer ſo great and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinnes againſt God. We haue ſeene how they make God to be mutable, in as much as he hath at her word oftentimes reuerſed his owne ſentence, &amp; ſaued them who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before he had condemned. Finally we haue ſeene, how flatly they contradict the Scriptures in moſt of theſe miracles: for the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 26.</note>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:14153:177"/> ſaith, that betwixt heauen and hell is ſuch a great gulfe or diſtance, that they which would goe from one place to an other can not: but they make this to be an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie matter, both for the virgin Marie, &amp; alſo for the angels, yea likewiſe for the ſoules of men.</p>
               <p>3 Further concerning thoſe miracles, which the Papiſts ſo falſly aſcribe vnto the virgin Marie, they are to be conſidered, not onely as a part of the matter of poperie: but alſo as a meanes and chiefe pillar whereby eſpecially the worſhip of the virgin in pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, hath bin vpholden and maintained. The ſame is likewiſe to be ſaide of the like mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of their other ſaints. For wherefore haue they read them, and preached them in their churches? hath it not bin to keepe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the more deuout worſhip of them, and to make them to thinke them halfe as good at the leaſt, as God himſelfe? verily it can not be denied.</p>
               <p>4 Now what vſe are we to make of all theſe things thus added to my former trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe? <note place="margin">The vſe of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It may be ſome will make none other vſe of them; it may be ſome will buie this whole booke, onely for that purpoſe: but truly ſuch ſhall greatly peruert my meaning. We may indeed (as before I haue ſaid in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe) laugh at them in ſome ſort, ſo we doe it in an holy manner with the ſpirit of Eliah, as
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:14153:177"/> he skorned the fooliſhnes or rather extreame madnes of the prieſts of Baal: but beſides this, we are to applie theſe thinges many other waies, which I will onely briefly note, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the further conſideration of them to the godly reader.</p>
               <p>5 Firſt therefore, ſith all theſe things doe moſt liuely ſhew the extreame follie, &amp; high abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of poperie: how ought all papiſts to be aſhamed of their religion? How ought all Proteſtants that ſometimes haue bin pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, to be grieued for their poperie? How ought they likewiſe to mourne for any of their frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, yea for any other yet remaining in that eſtate, &amp; yet ſhut vp in the ſhadow of death? How ioyfull likewiſe and thankfull ought we to be, that God hath opened our eies to ſee theſe things, that he hath not ſent his angel onely into our houſes (as ſometime he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of Lot, to take him &amp; guide him out of Sodo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before fire came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that citie) but alſo hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs his holy ſpirit in our hearts, &amp; thereby deliuered vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ridiculous, ſo groſſe, &amp; ſo horrible a religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>6 Further we ſee by theſe things, how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous it is not to beleeue the truth, and how blockiſh we are, if we be left vnto our ſelues. Verily there is no errour ſo fooliſh, ſo abſurd, ſo groſſe, ſo abominable, &amp; ſo monſtrous, but that if God doe forſake vs, if he take his ſpirit from vs, if he leaue vs to our ſelues, we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to beleeue it as truth; yea to be zealous
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:14153:178"/> therein; yea farre more zealous, then any of Gods owne children are in the truth.</p>
               <p>7 O therfore let vs not deceiue our ſelues: late vs hate poperie as ſuch a monſter ought to be hated: let vs make that account of the truth, &amp; giue ſuch credit &amp; obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce theru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, that for our conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt &amp; light account thereof, God neither giue poperie any returne againe vnto vs. Let vs earneſtly pray, let vs keepe watch by night &amp; ward by day, let vs alwaies with all carefulnes looke vnto our ſelues, let vs take heede of all Ieſuits, ſeminatie prieſts, yea of all papiſts, and likewiſe of all other meanes, whereby we may be entangled with this filthie &amp; ſottiſh religion, and be drawne thereunto. Let vs delight in the communion &amp; fellowſhip of al them that loue the truth, and are able to confirme, ſtrengthen, &amp; helpe vs forward in this religion which now generally we profeſſe; vſing all other good means com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs for the ſame end. Let vs take heed, not onely of the maine ſtock of poperie; but alſo of euery bough, branch, twigge, yea of euery leafe; for there is d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> leaſt patch of poperie. And as the whole ſubſtance of popiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was not hatched all at once, but now one egge laide laide and then an other; now one chicken, and then an other; now one opinion and then an other; vntill all the whole brood was come forth: and when it was throughly hatched &amp; brought forth, it had not all the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:14153:178"/> nor all the feathers, nor all the ſtrength the firſt day, but crept and got vp by litle and litle: ſo the deuil being ſtil as ſubtil as he was, and ſeeing poperie now to be baniſhed, and grieuing that it is forced to liue ſo long in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile, therefore daily laboureth (as alas by too great experience we daily ſee) by litle &amp; litle againe to winne vs thereunto. Priuately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede in many places of this land (and it is to be feared in too many. I pray God alſo that it be not in too great places, and with too great perſons) he laboureth, where the whole body of popery doth remaine, there to vphold it; and where it is not, there alſo wholly to bring it in againe. For we ſee many now to be Papiſts, euen of both ſexes, yea ſome to be recuſant papiſts, whoſe fathers: were little more then borne in the beginning of the raigne of her moſt excellent Maieſtie. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Satan the olde aduerſarie, where he thinketh he may be bold, and where he hath fitte inſtruments to worke by, hath in ſome priuate places, euen in this flouriſhing time and bright light of the goſpel, drawne ſome to the whole doctrine and religion of pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ie: yet he will not as yet be ſo bold as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt this publikely. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about it by degrees, &amp; by litle &amp; litle tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as it were) and filling his veſſels here &amp; there, one with ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g popiſh drink &amp; an other with ſmall, that is, one with a maine point of poperie, &amp; another with a ſmal point; yea not
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:14153:179"/> onely tunning &amp; filling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther with, but alſo tapping &amp; broching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo filled, &amp; giuing of the drink of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by whole kannes to other to drinke. And this he doth according to his old ſubtiltie, hoping the more eaſily to bring in &amp; to broach all againe &amp; ſo to make all drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe with the cuppe of fornications that is in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the whore &amp; ſtrumpet of Rome.</p>
               <p>8 Wherefore in the feare of God, &amp; in the tender loue that I beare vnto the ſoules of all, I doe admoniſh all to take heede of this euil. Whatſoeuer hath bin accounted poperie, &amp; by good reaſon ſhewed to be repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the truth, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon conſent of all churches refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med held as erronious &amp; heretical: let all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly take heed they neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue any good liking thereof again. If we feare any more to embrace all poperie, let vs take heede that in the mean time we neuer entertain any one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion therof, though neuer ſo litle. If we feare to be drunken with the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt drink, or with many cups of poperie, let vs refraine from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting therof. For as with them that delight in ſtrong drinke, one cup draweth on an other; ſo alſo may we feare it wil be with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which begin to ſmel of any one point of poperie. It is dangerous, it is dangerous to drinke in any one errour of poperie, though neuer ſo ſmall, eſpecially to perſiſt in the liking thereof &amp; to ſay when we haue taſted it, <hi>This is good:</hi> and moſt dangerous it is to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the ſame to other, &amp; to make them to drinke of the ſame
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:14153:179"/> cup with vs: all this is very da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous, whither we doe it for ſome good liking of the thing it ſelf, or in regard of our own eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or in any other reſpect whatſoeuer. For we may feare, leaſt the Lord harden our hearts, euen to like of thoſe errors which as yet our ſoules abhor.</p>
               <p>9 I write not this to gal or gird at any, or to diſgrace any one particular perſon (my heart hateth all ſuch hatred, &amp; delighteth in loue &amp; peace, &amp; as wel in the credit of other, as of my ſelfe) but in a general loue, I do generally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh all to take heede in this behalfe. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the like generall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, not admoniſhing ſome onely, but alſo euery one to take heed, <hi>leaſt at any time there ſhould be in any an euill &amp; vnfaithful heart to fal away</hi>
